present some experiments in both chess and backgammon which demonstrate its

used TDLeaf(lambda) to learn its evaluation function while playing on the Free
Internet Chess Server (FICS, fics.onenet.net). It improved from a 1650 rating

identify phrases in a tagged corpus that are useful for dialogue act tagging.
We found that a new method (which measures a phrase's deviation from an

9912008v2,New Error Bounds for Solomonoff Prediction,"Solomonoff sequence prediction is a scheme to predict digits of binary
strings without knowing the underlying probability distribution. We call a
prediction scheme informed when it knows the true probability distribution of
the sequence. Several new relations between universal Solomonoff sequence
prediction and informed prediction and general probabilistic prediction schemes
will be proved. Among others, they show that the number of errors in Solomonoff
prediction is finite for computable distributions, if finite in the informed
case. Deterministic variants will also be studied. The most interesting result
is that the deterministic variant of Solomonoff prediction is optimal compared
to any other probabilistic or deterministic prediction scheme apart from
additive square root corrections only. This makes it well suited even for
difficult prediction problems, where it does not suffice when the number of
errors is minimal to within some factor greater than one. Solomonoff's original
bound and the ones presented here complement each other in a useful way.",1999-12-13T08:33:43Z,Marcus Hutter
0005021v1,Modeling the Uncertainty in Complex Engineering Systems,"Existing procedures for model validation have been deemed inadequate for many
engineering systems. The reason of this inadequacy is due to the high degree of
complexity of the mechanisms that govern these systems. It is proposed in this
paper to shift the attention from modeling the engineering system itself to
modeling the uncertainty that underlies its behavior. A mathematical framework
for modeling the uncertainty in complex engineering systems is developed. This
framework uses the results of computational learning theory. It is based on the
premise that a system model is a learning machine.",2000-05-14T14:35:20Z,A. Guergachi
0109034v1,"Relevant Knowledge First - Reinforcement Learning and Forgetting in
  Knowledge Based Configuration","In order to solve complex configuration tasks in technical domains, various
knowledge based methods have been developed. However their applicability is
often unsuccessful due to their low efficiency. One of the reasons for this is
that (parts of the) problems have to be solved again and again, instead of
being ""learnt"" from preceding processes. However, learning processes bring with
them the problem of conservatism, for in technical domains innovation is a
deciding factor in competition. On the other hand a certain amount of
conservatism is often desired since uncontrolled innovation as a rule is also
detrimental. This paper proposes the heuristic RKF (Relevant Knowledge First)
for making decisions in configuration processes based on the so-called
relevance of objects in a knowledge base. The underlying relevance-function has
two components, one based on reinforcement learning and the other based on
forgetting (fading). Relevance of an object increases with its successful use
and decreases with age when it is not used. RKF has been developed to speed up
the configuration process and to improve the quality of the solutions relative
to the reward value that is given by users.",2001-09-19T08:07:38Z,"Ingo Kreuz, Dieter Roller"
0206006v1,Robust Feature Selection by Mutual Information Distributions,"Mutual information is widely used in artificial intelligence, in a
descriptive way, to measure the stochastic dependence of discrete random
variables. In order to address questions such as the reliability of the
empirical value, one must consider sample-to-population inferential approaches.
This paper deals with the distribution of mutual information, as obtained in a
Bayesian framework by a second-order Dirichlet prior distribution. The exact
analytical expression for the mean and an analytical approximation of the
variance are reported. Asymptotic approximations of the distribution are
proposed. The results are applied to the problem of selecting features for
incremental learning and classification of the naive Bayes classifier. A fast,
newly defined method is shown to outperform the traditional approach based on
empirical mutual information on a number of real data sets. Finally, a
theoretical development is reported that allows one to efficiently extend the
above methods to incomplete samples in an easy and effective way.",2002-06-03T16:00:55Z,"Marco Zaffalon, Marcus Hutter"
0206017v1,The Prioritized Inductive Logic Programs,"The limit behavior of inductive logic programs has not been explored, but
when considering incremental or online inductive learning algorithms which
usually run ongoingly, such behavior of the programs should be taken into
account. An example is given to show that some inductive learning algorithm may
not be correct in the long run if the limit behavior is not considered. An
inductive logic program is convergent if given an increasing sequence of
example sets, the program produces a corresponding sequence of the Horn logic
programs which has the set-theoretic limit, and is limit-correct if the limit
of the produced sequence of the Horn logic programs is correct with respect to
the limit of the sequence of the example sets. It is shown that the GOLEM
system is not limit-correct. Finally, a limit-correct inductive logic system,
called the prioritized GOLEM system, is proposed as a solution.",2002-06-10T16:02:36Z,"Shilong Ma, Yuefei Sui, Ke Xu"
0211006v1,Maximing the Margin in the Input Space,"We propose a novel criterion for support vector machine learning: maximizing
the margin in the input space, not in the feature (Hilbert) space. This
criterion is a discriminative version of the principal curve proposed by Hastie
et al. The criterion is appropriate in particular when the input space is
already a well-designed feature space with rather small dimensionality. The
definition of the margin is generalized in order to represent prior knowledge.
The derived algorithm consists of two alternating steps to estimate the dual
parameters. Firstly, the parameters are initialized by the original SVM. Then
one set of parameters is updated by Newton-like procedure, and the other set is
updated by solving a quadratic programming problem. The algorithm converges in
a few steps to a local optimum under mild conditions and it preserves the
sparsity of support vectors. Although the complexity to calculate temporal
variables increases the complexity to solve the quadratic programming problem
for each step does not change. It is also shown that the original SVM can be
seen as a special case. We further derive a simplified algorithm which enables
us to use the existing code for the original SVM.",2002-11-07T06:44:54Z,Shotaro Akaho

  Space Alignment","Nonlinear manifold learning from unorganized data points is a very
challenging unsupervised learning and data visualization problem with a great
variety of applications. In this paper we present a new algorithm for manifold
learning and nonlinear dimension reduction. Based on a set of unorganized data
points sampled with noise from the manifold, we represent the local geometry of
the manifold using tangent spaces learned by fitting an affine subspace in a
neighborhood of each data point. Those tangent spaces are aligned to give the
internal global coordinates of the data points with respect to the underlying
manifold by way of a partial eigendecomposition of the neighborhood connection
matrix. We present a careful error analysis of our algorithm and show that the
reconstruction errors are of second-order accuracy. We illustrate our algorithm

In turn, it is of considerable importance to make Kalman-filters amenable for
reinforcement learning. In the usual formulation of optimal control it is
computed off-line by solving a backward recursion. In this technical note we
show that slight modification of the linear-quadratic-Gaussian Kalman-filter
model allows the on-line estimation of optimal control and makes the bridge to
reinforcement learning. Moreover, the learning rule for value estimation
assumes a Hebbian form weighted by the error of the value estimation.",2003-01-09T15:08:47Z,"Istvan Szita, Andras Lorincz"

0403031v2,"Concept of E-machine: How does a ""dynamical"" brain learn to process
  ""symbolic"" information? Part I","The human brain has many remarkable information processing characteristics
that deeply puzzle scientists and engineers. Among the most important and the
most intriguing of these characteristics are the brain's broad universality as
a learning system and its mysterious ability to dynamically change
(reconfigure) its behavior depending on a combinatorial number of different
contexts.
  This paper discusses a class of hypothetically brain-like dynamically
reconfigurable associative learning systems that shed light on the possible
nature of these brain's properties. The systems are arranged on the general
principle referred to as the concept of E-machine.
  The paper addresses the following questions:
  1. How can ""dynamical"" neural networks function as universal programmable
""symbolic"" machines?
  2. What kind of a universal programmable symbolic machine can form
arbitrarily complex software in the process of programming similar to the
process of biological associative learning?

0403038v1,Tournament versus Fitness Uniform Selection,"In evolutionary algorithms a critical parameter that must be tuned is that of
selection pressure. If it is set too low then the rate of convergence towards
the optimum is likely to be slow. Alternatively if the selection pressure is
set too high the system is likely to become stuck in a local optimum due to a
loss of diversity in the population. The recent Fitness Uniform Selection
Scheme (FUSS) is a conceptually simple but somewhat radical approach to
addressing this problem - rather than biasing the selection towards higher
fitness, FUSS biases selection towards sparsely populated fitness levels. In
this paper we compare the relative performance of FUSS with the well known
tournament selection scheme on a range of problems.",2004-03-23T15:17:53Z,"Shane Legg, Marcus Hutter, Akshat Kumar"

0407016v1,Learning for Adaptive Real-time Search,"Real-time heuristic search is a popular model of acting and learning in
intelligent autonomous agents. Learning real-time search agents improve their
performance over time by acquiring and refining a value function guiding the
application of their actions. As computing the perfect value function is
typically intractable, a heuristic approximation is acquired instead. Most
studies of learning in real-time search (and reinforcement learning) assume
that a simple value-function-greedy policy is used to select actions. This is
in contrast to practice, where high-performance is usually attained by
interleaving planning and acting via a lookahead search of a non-trivial depth.
In this paper, we take a step toward bridging this gap and propose a novel
algorithm that (i) learns a heuristic function to be used specifically with a
lookahead-based policy, (ii) selects the lookahead depth adaptively in each
state, (iii) gives the user control over the trade-off between exploration and
exploitation. We extensively evaluate the algorithm in the sliding tile puzzle
testbed comparing it to the classical LRTA* and the more recent weighted LRTA*,
bounded LRTA*, and FALCONS. Improvements of 5 to 30 folds in convergence speed

of the networks were optimized in a unifying framework. Computational tests on
different problems indicate considerable advantages for the L1 regularization:
It had considerably better learning time and better interpolating capabilities.

the adversary. Our algorithm can significantly outperform standard experts

0504042v1,The Bayesian Decision Tree Technique with a Sweeping Strategy,"The uncertainty of classification outcomes is of crucial importance for many
safety critical applications including, for example, medical diagnostics. In
such applications the uncertainty of classification can be reliably estimated
within a Bayesian model averaging technique that allows the use of prior
information. Decision Tree (DT) classification models used within such a
technique gives experts additional information by making this classification
scheme observable. The use of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology
of stochastic sampling makes the Bayesian DT technique feasible to perform.
However, in practice, the MCMC technique may become stuck in a particular DT
which is far away from a region with a maximal posterior. Sampling such DTs
causes bias in the posterior estimates, and as a result the evaluation of
classification uncertainty may be incorrect. In a particular case, the negative
effect of such sampling may be reduced by giving additional prior information
on the shape of DTs. In this paper we describe a new approach based on sweeping
the DTs without additional priors on the favorite shape of DTs. The
performances of Bayesian DT techniques with the standard and sweeping
strategies are compared on a synthetic data as well as on real datasets.
Quantitatively evaluating the uncertainty in terms of entropy of class
posterior probabilities, we found that the sweeping strategy is superior to the
standard strategy.",2005-04-11T17:45:09Z,"V. Schetinin, J. E. Fieldsend, D. Partridge, W. J. Krzanowski, R. M. Everson, T. C. Bailey, A. Hernandez"

that the Bayesian DT technique is superior to the randomised DT ensemble
technique.",2005-04-11T17:53:35Z,"V. Schetinin, D. Partridge, W. J. Krzanowski, R. M. Everson, J. E. Fieldsend, T. C. Bailey, A. Hernandez"

are generated. However, standard algorithms in this area can only deal with
finite-dimensional (often countable) benchmark classes. In this paper we give
similar results for decision rules ranging over an arbitrary reproducing kernel
Hilbert space. For example, it is shown that for a wide class of loss functions
(including the standard square, absolute, and log loss functions) the average
loss of the master algorithm, over the first $N$ observations, does not exceed
the average loss of the best decision rule with a bounded norm plus
$O(N^{-1/2})$. Our proof technique is very different from the standard ones and

distribution in such a way that the resulting undirected graphical model is
sparse. Our approach is to solve a maximum likelihood problem with an added
l_1-norm penalty term. The problem as formulated is convex but the memory
requirements and complexity of existing interior point methods are prohibitive
for problems with more than tens of nodes. We present two new algorithms for
solving problems with at least a thousand nodes in the Gaussian case. Our first
algorithm uses block coordinate descent, and can be interpreted as recursive
l_1-norm penalized regression. Our second algorithm, based on Nesterov's first
order method, yields a complexity estimate with a better dependence on problem
size than existing interior point methods. Using a log determinant relaxation
of the log partition function (Wainwright & Jordan (2006)), we show that these
same algorithms can be used to solve an approximate sparse maximum likelihood
problem for the binary case. We test our algorithms on synthetic data, as well

We then use the same relaxation to derive sufficient conditions for global
optimality of a solution, which can be tested in O(n^3) per pattern. We discuss

their impact and implication for land cover mapping. The main finding from this
research is that whereas the 1AA technique is more predisposed to yielding
unclassified and mixed pixels, the resulting classification accuracy is not

one, the least-squares projection operator is modified so that it does not
increase max-norm, and thus preserves convergence. The other modification is
that we uniformly sample polynomially many samples from the (exponentially
large) state space. This way, the complexity of our algorithm becomes
polynomial in the size of the fMDP description length. We prove that the

Firstly, three popular learners, namely, ""neighborhood component analysis"",
""large margin nearest neighbors"" and ""discriminant neighborhood embedding"",

framework avoids troublesome problems such as singularity, etc. Thirdly, while
the truths of representer theorems are just assumptions in previous papers

from game records. The method is based on attempting to learn features of a
player's individual evaluation function using the method of temporal
differences, with the aid of a conventional Chess engine architecture. Some
encouraging results were obtained in learning the styles of two recent Chess
world champions, and we report on our attempt to use the learnt styles to
discriminate between the players from game records by trying to detect who was
playing white and who was playing black. We also discuss some limitations of
our approach and propose possible directions for future research. The method we

relevant application - web page ranking - exact inference is efficient. For
general model instances, an appropriate sampler is readily available. Contrary
to existing max-margin matching models, our approach is statistically
consistent and, in addition, experiments with increasing sample sizes indicate
superior improvement over such models. We apply the method to graph matching in
computer vision as well as to a standard benchmark dataset for learning web
page ranking, in which we obtain state-of-the-art results, in particular
improving on max-margin variants. The drawback of this method with respect to

initial model (FOIM) algorithm, maintains an empirical model of the FMDP in a
conventional way, and always follows a greedy policy with respect to its model.
The only trick of the algorithm is that the model is initialized
optimistically. We prove that with suitable initialization (i) FOIM converges
to the fixed point of approximate value iteration (AVI); (ii) the number of
steps when the agent makes non-near-optimal decisions (with respect to the
solution of AVI) is polynomial in all relevant quantities; (iii) the per-step

0906.0052v1,A Minimum Description Length Approach to Multitask Feature Selection,"Many regression problems involve not one but several response variables
(y's). Often the responses are suspected to share a common underlying
structure, in which case it may be advantageous to share information across
them; this is known as multitask learning. As a special case, we can use
multiple responses to better identify shared predictive features -- a project
we might call multitask feature selection.
  This thesis is organized as follows. Section 1 introduces feature selection
for regression, focusing on ell_0 regularization methods and their
interpretation within a Minimum Description Length (MDL) framework. Section 2
proposes a novel extension of MDL feature selection to the multitask setting.
The approach, called the ""Multiple Inclusion Criterion"" (MIC), is designed to
borrow information across regression tasks by more easily selecting features
that are associated with multiple responses. We show in experiments on
synthetic and real biological data sets that MIC can reduce prediction error in
settings where features are at least partially shared across responses. Section
3 surveys hypothesis testing by regression with a single response, focusing on
the parallel between the standard Bonferroni correction and an MDL approach.
Mirroring the ideas in Section 2, Section 4 proposes a novel MIC approach to
hypothesis testing with multiple responses and shows that on synthetic data
with significant sharing of features across responses, MIC sometimes
outperforms standard FDR-controlling methods in terms of finding true positives
for a given level of false positives. Section 5 concludes.",2009-05-30T03:41:37Z,Brian Tomasik
0906.1814v1,Large-Margin kNN Classification Using a Deep Encoder Network,"KNN is one of the most popular classification methods, but it often fails to
work well with inappropriate choice of distance metric or due to the presence
of numerous class-irrelevant features. Linear feature transformation methods
have been widely applied to extract class-relevant information to improve kNN
classification, which is very limited in many applications. Kernels have been
used to learn powerful non-linear feature transformations, but these methods
fail to scale to large datasets. In this paper, we present a scalable
non-linear feature mapping method based on a deep neural network pretrained
with restricted boltzmann machines for improving kNN classification in a
large-margin framework, which we call DNet-kNN. DNet-kNN can be used for both

0909.2934v1,A Convergent Online Single Time Scale Actor Critic Algorithm,"Actor-Critic based approaches were among the first to address reinforcement
learning in a general setting. Recently, these algorithms have gained renewed
interest due to their generality, good convergence properties, and possible
biological relevance. In this paper, we introduce an online temporal difference
based actor-critic algorithm which is proved to converge to a neighborhood of a
local maximum of the average reward. Linear function approximation is used by
the critic in order estimate the value function, and the temporal difference
signal, which is passed from the critic to the actor. The main distinguishing
feature of the present convergence proof is that both the actor and the critic
operate on a similar time scale, while in most current convergence proofs they
are required to have very different time scales in order to converge. Moreover,
the same temporal difference signal is used to update the parameters of both
the actor and the critic. A limitation of the proposed approach, compared to
results available for two time scale convergence, is that convergence is
guaranteed only to a neighborhood of an optimal value, rather to an optimal
value itself. The single time scale and identical temporal difference signal
used by the actor and the critic, may provide a step towards constructing more
biologically realistic models of reinforcement learning in the brain.",2009-09-16T07:08:44Z,"D. Di Castro, R. Meir"

base learners. It is well-known that to construct a good ensemble, the base
learners should be accurate as well as diverse. In this paper, unlabeled data
is exploited to facilitate ensemble learning by helping augment the diversity
among the base learners. Specifically, a semi-supervised ensemble method named
UDEED is proposed. Unlike existing semi-supervised ensemble methods where
error-prone pseudo-labels are estimated for unlabeled data to enlarge the
labeled data to improve accuracy, UDEED works by maximizing accuracies of base
learners on labeled data while maximizing diversity among them on unlabeled
data. Experiments show that UDEED can effectively utilize unlabeled data for

0910.0902v3,Reduced-Rank Hidden Markov Models,"We introduce the Reduced-Rank Hidden Markov Model (RR-HMM), a generalization
of HMMs that can model smooth state evolution as in Linear Dynamical Systems
(LDSs) as well as non-log-concave predictive distributions as in
continuous-observation HMMs. RR-HMMs assume an m-dimensional latent state and n
discrete observations, with a transition matrix of rank k <= m. This implies
the dynamics evolve in a k-dimensional subspace, while the shape of the set of
predictive distributions is determined by m. Latent state belief is represented
with a k-dimensional state vector and inference is carried out entirely in R^k,
making RR-HMMs as computationally efficient as k-state HMMs yet more
expressive. To learn RR-HMMs, we relax the assumptions of a recently proposed
spectral learning algorithm for HMMs (Hsu, Kakade and Zhang 2009) and apply it
to learn k-dimensional observable representations of rank-k RR-HMMs. The
algorithm is consistent and free of local optima, and we extend its performance
guarantees to cover the RR-HMM case. We show how this algorithm can be used in
conjunction with a kernel density estimator to efficiently model
high-dimensional multivariate continuous data. We also relax the assumption
that single observations are sufficient to disambiguate state, and extend the
algorithm accordingly. Experiments on synthetic data and a toy video, as well
as on a difficult robot vision modeling problem, yield accurate models that
compare favorably with standard alternatives in simulation quality and
prediction capability.",2009-10-06T06:00:47Z,"Sajid M. Siddiqi, Byron Boots, Geoffrey J. Gordon"

has shown that the use of meta-features, additional inputs describing each
example in a dataset, can boost the performance of ensemble methods, but the
greatest reported gains have come from nonlinear procedures requiring
significant tuning and training time. Here, we present a linear technique,
Feature-Weighted Linear Stacking (FWLS), that incorporates meta-features for
improved accuracy while retaining the well-known virtues of linear regression
regarding speed, stability, and interpretability. FWLS combines model
predictions linearly using coefficients that are themselves linear functions of
meta-features. This technique was a key facet of the solution of the second
place team in the recently concluded Netflix Prize competition. Significant
increases in accuracy over standard linear stacking are demonstrated on the

0911.5104v2,A Bayesian Rule for Adaptive Control based on Causal Interventions,"Explaining adaptive behavior is a central problem in artificial intelligence
research. Here we formalize adaptive agents as mixture distributions over
sequences of inputs and outputs (I/O). Each distribution of the mixture
constitutes a `possible world', but the agent does not know which of the
possible worlds it is actually facing. The problem is to adapt the I/O stream
in a way that is compatible with the true world. A natural measure of
adaptation can be obtained by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the
I/O distribution of the true world and the I/O distribution expected by the
agent that is uncertain about possible worlds. In the case of pure input
streams, the Bayesian mixture provides a well-known solution for this problem.
We show, however, that in the case of I/O streams this solution breaks down,
because outputs are issued by the agent itself and require a different
probabilistic syntax as provided by intervention calculus. Based on this
calculus, we obtain a Bayesian control rule that allows modeling adaptive
behavior with mixture distributions over I/O streams. This rule might allow for
a novel approach to adaptive control based on a minimum KL-principle.",2009-11-26T15:52:33Z,"Pedro A. Ortega, Daniel A. Braun"

learned model and recovering a policy which is near-optimal in the original
environment. Specifically, we present an efficient and statistically consistent
spectral algorithm for learning the parameters of a Predictive State
Representation (PSR). We demonstrate the algorithm by learning a model of a
simulated high-dimensional, vision-based mobile robot planning task, and then
perform approximate point-based planning in the learned PSR. Analysis of our
results shows that the algorithm learns a state space which efficiently
captures the essential features of the environment. This representation allows

The first assumption is that a particular counting problem can be solved
efficiently. The consequence is a generalisation of the classical ridge
regression for structured prediction. (ii) The second assumption is that a

introduced, generalizing classical kernel methods. The new learning methodology
provide a formal connection between computational architectures with multiple
layers and the theme of kernel learning in standard regularization methods.
First, a representer theorem for two-layer networks is presented, showing that
finite linear combinations of kernels on each layer are optimal architectures
whenever the corresponding functions solve suitable variational problems in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). The input-output map expressed by
these architectures turns out to be equivalent to a suitable single-layer
kernel machines in which the kernel function is also learned from the data.
Recently, the so-called multiple kernel learning methods have attracted
considerable attention in the machine learning literature. In this paper,
multiple kernel learning methods are shown to be specific cases of kernel
machines with two layers in which the second layer is linear. Finally, a simple
and effective multiple kernel learning method called RLS2 (regularized least
squares with two layers) is introduced, and his performances on several

We show that any cost function based prediction market can be interpreted as an
algorithm for the commonly studied problem of learning from expert advice by
equating trades made in the market with losses observed by the learning
algorithm. If the loss of the market organizer is bounded, this bound can be
used to derive an O(sqrt(T)) regret bound for the corresponding learning
algorithm. We then show that the class of markets with convex cost functions
exactly corresponds to the class of Follow the Regularized Leader learning
algorithms, with the choice of a cost function in the market corresponding to
the choice of a regularizer in the learning problem. Finally, we show an
equivalence between market scoring rules and prediction markets with convex
cost functions. This implies that market scoring rules can also be interpreted
naturally as Follow the Regularized Leader algorithms, and may be of
independent interest. These connections provide new insight into how it is that

1012.0930v3,Efficient Optimization of Performance Measures by Classifier Adaptation,"In practical applications, machine learning algorithms are often needed to
learn classifiers that optimize domain specific performance measures.
Previously, the research has focused on learning the needed classifier in
isolation, yet learning nonlinear classifier for nonlinear and nonsmooth
performance measures is still hard. In this paper, rather than learning the
needed classifier by optimizing specific performance measure directly, we
circumvent this problem by proposing a novel two-step approach called as CAPO,
namely to first train nonlinear auxiliary classifiers with existing learning
methods, and then to adapt auxiliary classifiers for specific performance
measures. In the first step, auxiliary classifiers can be obtained efficiently
by taking off-the-shelf learning algorithms. For the second step, we show that
the classifier adaptation problem can be reduced to a quadratic program
problem, which is similar to linear SVMperf and can be efficiently solved. By
exploiting nonlinear auxiliary classifiers, CAPO can generate nonlinear
classifier which optimizes a large variety of performance measures including
all the performance measure based on the contingency table and AUC, whilst

1012.2609v4,"Inverse-Category-Frequency based supervised term weighting scheme for
  text categorization","Term weighting schemes often dominate the performance of many classifiers,
such as kNN, centroid-based classifier and SVMs. The widely used term weighting
scheme in text categorization, i.e., tf.idf, is originated from information
retrieval (IR) field. The intuition behind idf for text categorization seems
less reasonable than IR. In this paper, we introduce inverse category frequency
(icf) into term weighting scheme and propose two novel approaches, i.e., tf.icf
and icf-based supervised term weighting schemes. The tf.icf adopts icf to
substitute idf factor and favors terms occurring in fewer categories, rather
than fewer documents. And the icf-based approach combines icf and relevance
frequency (rf) to weight terms in a supervised way. Our cross-classifier and
cross-corpus experiments have shown that our proposed approaches are superior

  its Relationship to Policy Gradient Learning","In this theoretical paper we are concerned with the problem of learning a
value function by a smooth general function approximator, to solve a
deterministic episodic control problem in a large continuous state space. It is
shown that learning the gradient of the value-function at every point along a
trajectory generated by a greedy policy is a sufficient condition for the
trajectory to be locally extremal, and often locally optimal, and we argue that
this brings greater efficiency to value-function learning. This contrasts to
traditional value-function learning in which the value-function must be learnt
over the whole of state space.
  It is also proven that policy-gradient learning applied to a greedy policy on
a value-function produces a weight update equivalent to a value-gradient weight
update, which provides a surprising connection between these two alternative
paradigms of reinforcement learning, and a convergence proof for control
problems with a value function represented by a general smooth function

1104.5256v1,Learning Undirected Graphical Models with Structure Penalty,"In undirected graphical models, learning the graph structure and learning the
functions that relate the predictive variables (features) to the responses
given the structure are two topics that have been widely investigated in
machine learning and statistics. Learning graphical models in two stages will
have problems because graph structure may change after considering the
features. The main contribution of this paper is the proposed method that
learns the graph structure and functions on the graph at the same time. General
graphical models with binary outcomes conditioned on predictive variables are
proved to be equivalent to multivariate Bernoulli model. The reparameterization
of the potential functions in graphical model by conditional log odds ratios in
multivariate Bernoulli model offers advantage in the representation of the
conditional independence structure in the model. Additionally, we impose a
structure penalty on groups of conditional log odds ratios to learn the graph
structure. These groups of functions are designed with overlaps to enforce
hierarchical function selection. In this way, we are able to shrink higher
order interactions to obtain a sparse graph structure. Simulation studies show
that the method is able to recover the graph structure. The analysis of county

1105.2943v1,Feature Selection for MAUC-Oriented Classification Systems,"Feature selection is an important pre-processing step for many pattern
classification tasks. Traditionally, feature selection methods are designed to
obtain a feature subset that can lead to high classification accuracy. However,
classification accuracy has recently been shown to be an inappropriate
performance metric of classification systems in many cases. Instead, the Area
Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) and its multi-class
extension, MAUC, have been proved to be better alternatives. Hence, the target
of classification system design is gradually shifting from seeking a system
with the maximum classification accuracy to obtaining a system with the maximum
AUC/MAUC. Previous investigations have shown that traditional feature selection
methods need to be modified to cope with this new objective. These methods most
often are restricted to binary classification problems only. In this study, a
filter feature selection method, namely MAUC Decomposition based Feature
Selection (MDFS), is proposed for multi-class classification problems. To the
best of our knowledge, MDFS is the first method specifically designed to select

instances given feedback in the form of preference judgments, i.e., statements
to the effect that one instance should be ranked ahead of another. We outline a
two-stage approach in which one first learns by conventional means a binary
preference function indicating whether it is advisable to rank one instance
before another. Here we consider an on-line algorithm for learning preference
functions that is based on Freund and Schapire's 'Hedge' algorithm. In the
second stage, new instances are ordered so as to maximize agreement with the
learned preference function. We show that the problem of finding the ordering
that agrees best with a learned preference function is NP-complete.
Nevertheless, we describe simple greedy algorithms that are guaranteed to find
a good approximation. Finally, we show how metasearch can be formulated as an
ordering problem, and present experimental results on learning a combination of

contrary, here we show that many probability distributions have marginals that
cannot be reached by belief propagation using any set of model parameters or
any learning algorithm. We call such marginals `unbelievable.' This problem
occurs whenever the Hessian of the Bethe free energy is not positive-definite
at the target marginals. All learning algorithms for belief propagation
necessarily fail in these cases, producing beliefs or sets of beliefs that may
even be worse than the pre-learning approximation. We then show that averaging

cooperative teachers or other more experienced agents. We propose and study a
formal model of implicit imitation that can accelerate reinforcement learning
dramatically in certain cases. Roughly, by observing a mentor, a
reinforcement-learning agent can extract information about its own capabilities
in, and the relative value of, unvisited parts of the state space. We study two
specific instantiations of this model, one in which the learning agent and the
mentor have identical abilities, and one designed to deal with agents and
mentors with different action sets. We illustrate the benefits of implicit
imitation by integrating it with prioritized sweeping, and demonstrating
improved performance and convergence through observation of single and multiple

1106.0707v1,Efficient Reinforcement Learning Using Recursive Least-Squares Methods,"The recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm is one of the most well-known
algorithms used in adaptive filtering, system identification and adaptive
control. Its popularity is mainly due to its fast convergence speed, which is
considered to be optimal in practice. In this paper, RLS methods are used to
solve reinforcement learning problems, where two new reinforcement learning
algorithms using linear value function approximators are proposed and analyzed.
The two algorithms are called RLS-TD(lambda) and Fast-AHC (Fast Adaptive
Heuristic Critic), respectively. RLS-TD(lambda) can be viewed as the extension
of RLS-TD(0) from lambda=0 to general lambda within interval [0,1], so it is a
multi-step temporal-difference (TD) learning algorithm using RLS methods. The
convergence with probability one and the limit of convergence of RLS-TD(lambda)
are proved for ergodic Markov chains. Compared to the existing LS-TD(lambda)
algorithm, RLS-TD(lambda) has advantages in computation and is more suitable
for online learning. The effectiveness of RLS-TD(lambda) is analyzed and
verified by learning prediction experiments of Markov chains with a wide range
of parameter settings. The Fast-AHC algorithm is derived by applying the
proposed RLS-TD(lambda) algorithm in the critic network of the adaptive
heuristic critic method. Unlike conventional AHC algorithm, Fast-AHC makes use
of RLS methods to improve the learning-prediction efficiency in the critic.
Learning control experiments of the cart-pole balancing and the acrobot
swing-up problems are conducted to compare the data efficiency of Fast-AHC with
conventional AHC. From the experimental results, it is shown that the data
efficiency of learning control can also be improved by using RLS methods in the
learning-prediction process of the critic. The performance of Fast-AHC is also
compared with that of the AHC method using LS-TD(lambda). Furthermore, it is
demonstrated in the experiments that different initial values of the variance
matrix in RLS-TD(lambda) are required to get better performance not only in
learning prediction but also in learning control. The experimental results are

nearest neighbor class of a test object is the class that maximizes the
probability of providing its nearest neighbor. It is provided evidence that the
former concept is much more powerful than the latter one in the presence of
uncertainty, in that it correctly models the right semantics of the nearest
neighbor decision rule when applied to the uncertain scenario. An effective and
efficient algorithm to perform uncertain nearest neighbor classification of a
generic (un)certain test object is designed, based on properties that greatly

that provably solves all previously learned tasks plus the new one, while the
unmodified predecessor does not. Wow-effects are achieved by continually making
previously learned skills more efficient such that they require less time and
space. New skills may (partially) re-use previously learned skills. POWERPLAY's
search orders candidate pairs of tasks and solver modifications by their
conditional computational (time & space) complexity, given the stored
experience so far. The new task and its corresponding task-solving skill are
those first found and validated. The computational costs of validating new
tasks need not grow with task repertoire size. POWERPLAY's ongoing search for
novelty keeps breaking the generalization abilities of its present solver. This
is related to Goedel's sequence of increasingly powerful formal theories based
on adding formerly unprovable statements to the axioms without affecting
previously provable theorems. The continually increasing repertoire of problem
solving procedures can be exploited by a parallel search for solutions to
additional externally posed tasks. POWERPLAY may be viewed as a greedy but
practical implementation of basic principles of creativity. A first
experimental analysis can be found in separate papers [53,54].",2011-12-22T13:50:46Z,Jürgen Schmidhuber
1201.4777v2,A probabilistic methodology for multilabel classification,"Multilabel classification is a relatively recent subfield of machine
learning. Unlike to the classical approach, where instances are labeled with
only one category, in multilabel classification, an arbitrary number of
categories is chosen to label an instance. Due to the problem complexity (the
solution is one among an exponential number of alternatives), a very common
solution (the binary method) is frequently used, learning a binary classifier
for every category, and combining them all afterwards. The assumption taken in
this solution is not realistic, and in this work we give examples where the
decisions for all the labels are not taken independently, and thus, a
supervised approach should learn those existing relationships among categories
to make a better classification. Therefore, we show here a generic methodology
that can improve the results obtained by a set of independent probabilistic
binary classifiers, by using a combination procedure with a classifier trained
on the co-occurrences of the labels. We show an exhaustive experimentation in
three different standard corpora of labeled documents (Reuters-21578,
Ohsumed-23 and RCV1), which present noticeable improvements in all of them,
when using our methodology, in three probabilistic base classifiers.",2012-01-23T17:25:34Z,"Alfonso E. Romero, Luis M. de Campos"

1201.6583v1,Empowerment for Continuous Agent-Environment Systems,"This paper develops generalizations of empowerment to continuous states.
Empowerment is a recently introduced information-theoretic quantity motivated
by hypotheses about the efficiency of the sensorimotor loop in biological
organisms, but also from considerations stemming from curiosity-driven
learning. Empowemerment measures, for agent-environment systems with stochastic
transitions, how much influence an agent has on its environment, but only that
influence that can be sensed by the agent sensors. It is an
information-theoretic generalization of joint controllability (influence on
environment) and observability (measurement by sensors) of the environment by
the agent, both controllability and observability being usually defined in
control theory as the dimensionality of the control/observation spaces. Earlier
work has shown that empowerment has various interesting and relevant
properties, e.g., it allows us to identify salient states using only the
dynamics, and it can act as intrinsic reward without requiring an external
reward. However, in this previous work empowerment was limited to the case of
small-scale and discrete domains and furthermore state transition probabilities
were assumed to be known. The goal of this paper is to extend empowerment to
the significantly more important and relevant case of continuous vector-valued
state spaces and initially unknown state transition probabilities. The
continuous state space is addressed by Monte-Carlo approximation; the unknown
transitions are addressed by model learning and prediction for which we apply
Gaussian processes regression with iterated forecasting. In a number of
well-known continuous control tasks we examine the dynamics induced by
empowerment and include an application to exploration and online model
learning.",2012-01-31T15:46:27Z,"Tobias Jung, Daniel Polani, Peter Stone"
1201.6604v1,"Gaussian Processes for Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning with
  RMAX-like Exploration","We present an implementation of model-based online reinforcement learning
(RL) for continuous domains with deterministic transitions that is specifically
designed to achieve low sample complexity. To achieve low sample complexity,
since the environment is unknown, an agent must intelligently balance
exploration and exploitation, and must be able to rapidly generalize from
observations. While in the past a number of related sample efficient RL
algorithms have been proposed, to allow theoretical analysis, mainly
model-learners with weak generalization capabilities were considered. Here, we
separate function approximation in the model learner (which does require
samples) from the interpolation in the planner (which does not require
samples). For model-learning we apply Gaussian processes regression (GP) which
is able to automatically adjust itself to the complexity of the problem (via
Bayesian hyperparameter selection) and, in practice, often able to learn a
highly accurate model from very little data. In addition, a GP provides a
natural way to determine the uncertainty of its predictions, which allows us to
implement the ""optimism in the face of uncertainty"" principle used to
efficiently control exploration. Our method is evaluated on four common

  Selection","Feature selection in reinforcement learning (RL), i.e. choosing basis
functions such that useful approximations of the unkown value function can be
obtained, is one of the main challenges in scaling RL to real-world
applications. Here we consider the Gaussian process based framework GPTD for
approximate policy evaluation, and propose feature selection through marginal
likelihood optimization of the associated hyperparameters. Our approach has two
appealing benefits: (1) given just sample transitions, we can solve the policy
evaluation problem fully automatically (without looking at the learning task,
and, in theory, independent of the dimensionality of the state space), and (2)
model selection allows us to consider more sophisticated kernels, which in turn
enable us to identify relevant subspaces and eliminate irrelevant state
variables such that we can achieve substantial computational savings and
improved prediction performance.",2012-01-31T16:57:55Z,"Tobias Jung, Peter Stone"
1202.5597v3,Hybrid Batch Bayesian Optimization,"Bayesian Optimization aims at optimizing an unknown non-convex/concave
function that is costly to evaluate. We are interested in application scenarios
where concurrent function evaluations are possible. Under such a setting, BO
could choose to either sequentially evaluate the function, one input at a time
and wait for the output of the function before making the next selection, or
evaluate the function at a batch of multiple inputs at once. These two
different settings are commonly referred to as the sequential and batch
settings of Bayesian Optimization. In general, the sequential setting leads to
better optimization performance as each function evaluation is selected with
more information, whereas the batch setting has an advantage in terms of the
total experimental time (the number of iterations). In this work, our goal is
to combine the strength of both settings. Specifically, we systematically
analyze Bayesian optimization using Gaussian process as the posterior estimator
and provide a hybrid algorithm that, based on the current state, dynamically
switches between a sequential policy and a batch policy with variable batch
sizes. We provide theoretical justification for our algorithm and present
experimental results on eight benchmark BO problems. The results show that our
method achieves substantial speedup (up to %78) compared to a pure sequential
policy, without suffering any significant performance loss.",2012-02-25T02:00:51Z,"Javad Azimi, Ali Jalali, Xiaoli Fern"
1203.0550v3,Algorithms for Learning Kernels Based on Centered Alignment,"This paper presents new and effective algorithms for learning kernels. In
particular, as shown by our empirical results, these algorithms consistently
outperform the so-called uniform combination solution that has proven to be
difficult to improve upon in the past, as well as other algorithms for learning
kernels based on convex combinations of base kernels in both classification and
regression. Our algorithms are based on the notion of centered alignment which
is used as a similarity measure between kernels or kernel matrices. We present
a number of novel algorithmic, theoretical, and empirical results for learning
kernels based on our notion of centered alignment. In particular, we describe
efficient algorithms for learning a maximum alignment kernel by showing that
the problem can be reduced to a simple QP and discuss a one-stage algorithm for
learning both a kernel and a hypothesis based on that kernel using an
alignment-based regularization. Our theoretical results include a novel
concentration bound for centered alignment between kernel matrices, the proof
of the existence of effective predictors for kernels with high alignment, both
for classification and for regression, and the proof of stability-based
generalization bounds for a broad family of algorithms for learning kernels
based on centered alignment. We also report the results of experiments with our

1203.2990v2,Evolving Culture vs Local Minima,"We propose a theory that relates difficulty of learning in deep architectures
to culture and language. It is articulated around the following hypotheses: (1)
learning in an individual human brain is hampered by the presence of effective
local minima; (2) this optimization difficulty is particularly important when
it comes to learning higher-level abstractions, i.e., concepts that cover a
vast and highly-nonlinear span of sensory configurations; (3) such high-level
abstractions are best represented in brains by the composition of many levels
of representation, i.e., by deep architectures; (4) a human brain can learn
such high-level abstractions if guided by the signals produced by other humans,
which act as hints or indirect supervision for these high-level abstractions;
and (5), language and the recombination and optimization of mental concepts
provide an efficient evolutionary recombination operator, and this gives rise
to rapid search in the space of communicable ideas that help humans build up
better high-level internal representations of their world. These hypotheses put
together imply that human culture and the evolution of ideas have been crucial
to counter an optimization difficulty: this optimization difficulty would
otherwise make it very difficult for human brains to capture high-level
knowledge of the world. The theory is grounded in experimental observations of
the difficulties of training deep artificial neural networks. Plausible
consequences of this theory for the efficiency of cultural evolutions are
sketched.",2012-03-14T02:38:35Z,Yoshua Bengio

1206.3382v2,"Simple Regret Optimization in Online Planning for Markov Decision
  Processes","We consider online planning in Markov decision processes (MDPs). In online
planning, the agent focuses on its current state only, deliberates about the
set of possible policies from that state onwards and, when interrupted, uses
the outcome of that exploratory deliberation to choose what action to perform
next. The performance of algorithms for online planning is assessed in terms of
simple regret, which is the agent's expected performance loss when the chosen
action, rather than an optimal one, is followed.
  To date, state-of-the-art algorithms for online planning in general MDPs are
either best effort, or guarantee only polynomial-rate reduction of simple
regret over time. Here we introduce a new Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm,
BRUE, that guarantees exponential-rate reduction of simple regret and error
probability. This algorithm is based on a simple yet non-standard state-space
sampling scheme, MCTS2e, in which different parts of each sample are dedicated
to different exploratory objectives. Our empirical evaluation shows that BRUE
not only provides superior performance guarantees, but is also very effective
in practice and favorably compares to state-of-the-art. We then extend BRUE
with a variant of ""learning by forgetting."" The resulting set of algorithms,
BRUE(alpha), generalizes BRUE, improves the exponential factor in the upper
bound on its reduction rate, and exhibits even more attractive empirical
performance.",2012-06-15T07:23:28Z,"Zohar Feldman, Carmel Domshlak"
1206.4604v1,Learning the Experts for Online Sequence Prediction,"Online sequence prediction is the problem of predicting the next element of a
sequence given previous elements. This problem has been extensively studied in
the context of individual sequence prediction, where no prior assumptions are
made on the origin of the sequence. Individual sequence prediction algorithms
work quite well for long sequences, where the algorithm has enough time to
learn the temporal structure of the sequence. However, they might give poor
predictions for short sequences. A possible remedy is to rely on the general
model of prediction with expert advice, where the learner has access to a set
of $r$ experts, each of which makes its own predictions on the sequence. It is
well known that it is possible to predict almost as well as the best expert if
the sequence length is order of $\log(r)$. But, without firm prior knowledge on
the problem, it is not clear how to choose a small set of {\em good} experts.
In this paper we describe and analyze a new algorithm that learns a good set of
experts using a training set of previously observed sequences. We demonstrate
the merits of our approach by applying it on the task of click prediction on

matrix models pose challenges since the number of free parameters in the
covariance of the distribution scales as $n^4$ with the dimension $n$ of the
matrix, and $n$ tends to be large in real applications. We describe, analyze
and experiment with two new algorithms for learning distribution of matrix
models. Our first algorithm maintains a diagonal covariance over the parameters
and can handle large covariance matrices. The second algorithm factors the
covariance to capture inter-features correlation while keeping the number of
parameters linear in the size of the original matrix. We analyze both
algorithms in the mistake bound model and show a superior precision performance
of our approach over other algorithms in two tasks: retrieving similar images,
and ranking similar documents. The factored algorithm is shown to attain faster

1206.4652v1,The Most Persistent Soft-Clique in a Set of Sampled Graphs,"When searching for characteristic subpatterns in potentially noisy graph
data, it appears self-evident that having multiple observations would be better
than having just one. However, it turns out that the inconsistencies introduced
when different graph instances have different edge sets pose a serious
challenge. In this work we address this challenge for the problem of finding
maximum weighted cliques.
  We introduce the concept of most persistent soft-clique. This is subset of
vertices, that 1) is almost fully or at least densely connected, 2) occurs in
all or almost all graph instances, and 3) has the maximum weight. We present a
measure of clique-ness, that essentially counts the number of edge missing to
make a subset of vertices into a clique. With this measure, we show that the
problem of finding the most persistent soft-clique problem can be cast either
as: a) a max-min two person game optimization problem, or b) a min-min soft
margin optimization problem. Both formulations lead to the same solution when
using a partial Lagrangian method to solve the optimization problems. By
experiments on synthetic data and on real social network data, we show that the
proposed method is able to reliably find soft cliques in graph data, even if
that is distorted by random noise or unreliable observations.",2012-06-18T15:24:31Z,"Novi Quadrianto, Chao Chen, Christoph Lampert"
1206.6262v1,Scaling Life-long Off-policy Learning,"We pursue a life-long learning approach to artificial intelligence that makes
extensive use of reinforcement learning algorithms. We build on our prior work
with general value functions (GVFs) and the Horde architecture. GVFs have been
shown able to represent a wide variety of facts about the world's dynamics that
may be useful to a long-lived agent (Sutton et al. 2011). We have also
previously shown scaling - that thousands of on-policy GVFs can be learned
accurately in real-time on a mobile robot (Modayil, White & Sutton 2011). That
work was limited in that it learned about only one policy at a time, whereas
the greatest potential benefits of life-long learning come from learning about
many policies in parallel, as we explore in this paper. Many new challenges
arise in this off-policy learning setting. To deal with convergence and
efficiency challenges, we utilize the recently introduced GTD({\lambda})
algorithm. We show that GTD({\lambda}) with tile coding can simultaneously
learn hundreds of predictions for five simple target policies while following a
single random behavior policy, assessing accuracy with interspersed on-policy
tests. To escape the need for the tests, which preclude further scaling, we
introduce and empirically vali- date two online estimators of the off-policy
objective (MSPBE). Finally, we use the more efficient of the two estimators to
demonstrate off-policy learning at scale - the learning of value functions for
one thousand policies in real time on a physical robot. This ability
constitutes a significant step towards scaling life-long off-policy learning.",2012-06-27T13:27:56Z,"Adam White, Joseph Modayil, Richard S. Sutton"

models are temporal abstractions that, like macro-operators in classical
planning, jump directly from a start state to an end state. Prior work has
focused on constructing option models from primitive actions, by intra-option
model learning; or on using option models to construct a value function, by
inter-option planning. We present a unified view of intra- and inter-option
model learning, based on a major generalisation of the Bellman equation. Our
fundamental operation is the recursive composition of option models into other
option models. This key idea enables compositional planning over many levels of
abstraction. We illustrate our framework using a dynamic programming algorithm
that simultaneously constructs optimal option models for multiple subgoals, and
also searches over those option models to provide rapid progress towards other
subgoals.",2012-06-27T19:59:59Z,"David Silver, Kamil Ciosek"

1206.6838v1,Continuous Time Markov Networks,"A central task in many applications is reasoning about processes that change
in a continuous time. The mathematical framework of Continuous Time Markov
Processes provides the basic foundations for modeling such systems. Recently,
Nodelman et al introduced continuous time Bayesian networks (CTBNs), which
allow a compact representation of continuous-time processes over a factored
state space. In this paper, we introduce continuous time Markov networks
(CTMNs), an alternative representation language that represents a different
type of continuous-time dynamics. In many real life processes, such as
biological and chemical systems, the dynamics of the process can be naturally
described as an interplay between two forces - the tendency of each entity to
change its state, and the overall fitness or energy function of the entire
system. In our model, the first force is described by a continuous-time
proposal process that suggests possible local changes to the state of the
system at different rates. The second force is represented by a Markov network
that encodes the fitness, or desirability, of different states; a proposed
local change is then accepted with a probability that is a function of the
change in the fitness distribution. We show that the fitness distribution is
also the stationary distribution of the Markov process, so that this
representation provides a characterization of a temporal process whose
stationary distribution has a compact graphical representation. This allows us
to naturally capture a different type of structure in complex dynamical
processes, such as evolving biological sequences. We describe the semantics of
the representation, its basic properties, and how it compares to CTBNs. We also
provide algorithms for learning such models from data, and discuss its
applicability to biological sequence evolution.",2012-06-27T16:19:16Z,"Tal El-Hay, Nir Friedman, Daphne Koller, Raz Kupferman"

for approximate inference tasks in AI and machine learning. However, the choice
of a good set of clusters to be used in GBP has remained more of an art then a
science until this day. This paper proposes a sequential approach to adding new
clusters of nodes and their interactions (i.e. ""regions"") to the approximation.
We first review and analyze the recently introduced region graphs and find that
three kinds of operations (""split"", ""merge"" and ""death"") leave the free energy
and (under some conditions) the fixed points of GBP invariant. This leads to
the notion of ""weakly irreducible"" regions as the natural candidates to be
added to the approximation. Computational complexity of the GBP algorithm is
controlled by restricting attention to regions with small ""region-width"".
Combining the above with an efficient (i.e. local in the graph) measure to
predict the improved accuracy of GBP leads to the sequential ""region pursuit""
algorithm for adding new regions bottom-up to the region graph. Experiments
show that this algorithm can indeed perform close to optimally.",2012-07-11T15:01:36Z,Max Welling

the system as a set of predictions of observable outcomes of experiments one
can do in the system. This makes PSRs rather different from history-based

HMMs and POMDPs. We introduce an interesting construct, the systemdynamics

search differs from MAB in that in MCTS it is usually only the final ""arm pull""

pulls"". Therefore, it makes more sense to minimize the simple regret, as
opposed to the cumulative regret. We begin by introducing policies for
multi-armed bandits with lower finite-time and asymptotic simple regret than
UCB, using it to develop a two-stage scheme (SR+CR) for MCTS which outperforms
UCT empirically.
  Optimizing the sampling process is itself a metareasoning problem, a solution
of which can use value of information (VOI) techniques. Although the theory of
VOI for search exists, applying it to MCTS is non-trivial, as typical myopic
assumptions fail. Lacking a complete working VOI theory for MCTS, we

solving the new problem on medium-sized data. As the backtracking algorithm is

1210.1317v1,"Learning Heterogeneous Similarity Measures for Hybrid-Recommendations in
  Meta-Mining","The notion of meta-mining has appeared recently and extends the traditional
meta-learning in two ways. First it does not learn meta-models that provide
support only for the learning algorithm selection task but ones that support
the whole data-mining process. In addition it abandons the so called black-box
approach to algorithm description followed in meta-learning. Now in addition to
the datasets, algorithms also have descriptors, workflows as well. For the
latter two these descriptions are semantic, describing properties of the
algorithms. With the availability of descriptors both for datasets and data
mining workflows the traditional modelling techniques followed in
meta-learning, typically based on classification and regression algorithms, are
no longer appropriate. Instead we are faced with a problem the nature of which
is much more similar to the problems that appear in recommendation systems. The
most important meta-mining requirements are that suggestions should use only
datasets and workflows descriptors and the cold-start problem, e.g. providing
workflow suggestions for new datasets.
  In this paper we take a different view on the meta-mining modelling problem
and treat it as a recommender problem. In order to account for the meta-mining
specificities we derive a novel metric-based-learning recommender approach. Our
method learns two homogeneous metrics, one in the dataset and one in the
workflow space, and a heterogeneous one in the dataset-workflow space. All
learned metrics reflect similarities established from the dataset-workflow

1210.2640v1,"Multi-view constrained clustering with an incomplete mapping between
  views","Multi-view learning algorithms typically assume a complete bipartite mapping
between the different views in order to exchange information during the
learning process. However, many applications provide only a partial mapping
between the views, creating a challenge for current methods. To address this
problem, we propose a multi-view algorithm based on constrained clustering that
can operate with an incomplete mapping. Given a set of pairwise constraints in
each view, our approach propagates these constraints using a local similarity
measure to those instances that can be mapped to the other views, allowing the
propagated constraints to be transferred across views via the partial mapping.
It uses co-EM to iteratively estimate the propagation within each view based on
the current clustering model, transfer the constraints across views, and then
update the clustering model. By alternating the learning process between views,
this approach produces a unified clustering model that is consistent with all
views. We show that this approach significantly improves clustering performance
over several other methods for transferring constraints and allows multi-view
clustering to be reliably applied when given a limited mapping between the
views. Our evaluation reveals that the propagated constraints have high
precision with respect to the true clusters in the data, explaining their
benefit to clustering performance in both single- and multi-view learning
scenarios.",2012-10-09T15:25:01Z,"Eric Eaton, Marie desJardins, Sara Jacob"
1210.4870v1,Crowdsourcing Control: Moving Beyond Multiple Choice,"To ensure quality results from crowdsourced tasks, requesters often aggregate
worker responses and use one of a plethora of strategies to infer the correct
answer from the set of noisy responses. However, all current models assume
prior knowledge of all possible outcomes of the task. While not an unreasonable
assumption for tasks that can be posited as multiple-choice questions (e.g.
n-ary classification), we observe that many tasks do not naturally fit this
paradigm, but instead demand a free-response formulation where the outcome
space is of infinite size (e.g. audio transcription). We model such tasks with
a novel probabilistic graphical model, and design and implement LazySusan, a
decision-theoretic controller that dynamically requests responses as necessary
in order to infer answers to these tasks. We also design an EM algorithm to
jointly learn the parameters of our model while inferring the correct answers
to multiple tasks at a time. Live experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk
demonstrate the superiority of LazySusan at solving SAT Math questions,
eliminating 83.2% of the error and achieving greater net utility compared to
the state-ofthe-art strategy, majority-voting. We also show in live experiments

large amounts of real-time data to monitor and control complex engineering
systems. However, in many cases the collected data may be incomplete or
inconsistent, while the underlying environment may be time-varying or
un-formulated. In this paper, we have developed an innovative cognitive fault
diagnosis framework that tackles the above challenges. This framework
investigates fault diagnosis in the model space instead of in the signal space.
Learning in the model space is implemented by fitting a series of models using
a series of signal segments selected with a rolling window. By investigating
the learning techniques in the fitted model space, faulty models can be
discriminated from healthy models using one-class learning algorithm. The
framework enables us to construct fault library when unknown faults occur,
which can be regarded as cognitive fault isolation. This paper also
theoretically investigates how to measure the pairwise distance between two
models in the model space and incorporates the model distance into the learning
algorithm in the model space. The results on three benchmark applications and

the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",2012-10-31T10:42:32Z,"Huanhuan Chen, Peter Tino, Xin Yao, Ali Rodan"

the community of biomedical engineering due to its important applications in
medicine. In this work, a simple yet effective bag-of-words representation that

proposed for biomedical time series representation. In particular, similar to
the bag-of-words model used in text document domain, the proposed method treats
a time series as a text document and extracts local segments from the time
series as words. The biomedical time series is then represented as a histogram
of codewords, each entry of which is the count of a codeword appeared in the
time series. Although the temporal order of the local segments is ignored, the
bag-of-words representation is able to capture high-level structural
information because both local and global structural information are well
utilized. The performance of the bag-of-words model is validated on three
datasets extracted from real EEG and ECG signals. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method is not only insensitive to parameters of
the bag-of-words model such as local segment length and codebook size, but also

loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian
networks. All three algorithms try to recover an approximate distribution which
is close in KL divergence to the true distribution. Loopy belief propagation,
because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for a limited class of
belief networks, such as those which are purely discrete. Expectation
Propagation approximates the belief states by only retaining certain
expectations, such as mean and variance, and iterates until these expectations
are consistent throughout the network. This makes it applicable to hybrid
networks with discrete and continuous nodes. Expectation Propagation also
extends belief propagation in the opposite direction - it can propagate richer
belief states that incorporate correlations between nodes. Experiments with
Gaussian mixture models show Expectation Propagation to be convincingly better
than methods with similar computational cost: Laplace's method, variational

phases, first we update the pairwise probabilities, given the marginal
probabilities at each unit,using an analytic expression. Next, we update the
marginal probabilities, given the pairwise probabilities by following the
negative gradient of the Bethe free energy. Both steps are guaranteed to
decrease the Bethe free energy, and since it is lower bounded, the algorithm is
guaranteed to converge to a local minimum. We also show that the Bethe free
energy is equal to the TAP free energy up to second order in the weights. In
experiments we confirm that when belief propagation converges it usually finds
identical solutions as our belief optimization method. However, in cases where
belief propagation fails to converge, belief optimization continues to converge

to a new class of model-based reinforcement learning methods that exhibit much

1301.3720v2,The IBMAP approach for Markov networks structure learning,"In this work we consider the problem of learning the structure of Markov
networks from data. We present an approach for tackling this problem called
IBMAP, together with an efficient instantiation of the approach: the IBMAP-HC
algorithm, designed for avoiding important limitations of existing
independence-based algorithms. These algorithms proceed by performing
statistical independence tests on data, trusting completely the outcome of each
test. In practice tests may be incorrect, resulting in potential cascading
errors and the consequent reduction in the quality of the structures learned.
IBMAP contemplates this uncertainty in the outcome of the tests through a
probabilistic maximum-a-posteriori approach. The approach is instantiated in
the IBMAP-HC algorithm, a structure selection strategy that performs a
polynomial heuristic local search in the space of possible structures. We
present an extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and real data, showing
that our algorithm outperforms significantly the current independence-based
algorithms, in terms of data efficiency and quality of learned structures, with
equivalent computational complexities. We also show the performance of IBMAP-HC
in a real-world application of knowledge discovery: EDAs, which are
evolutionary algorithms that use structure learning on each generation for
modeling the distribution of populations. The experiments show that when

density function over its possible values. We show that we can apply
statistical density estimation techniques to learn such a density function from
a database of partially elicited utility functions. In particular, we define a
Bayesian learning framework for this problem, assuming the distribution over
utilities is a mixture of Gaussians, where the mixture components represent
statistically coherent subpopulations. We can also extend our techniques to the
problem of discovering generalized additivity structure in the utility
functions in the population. We define a Bayesian model selection criterion for
utility function structure and a search procedure over structures. The
factorization of the utilities in the learned model, and the generalization
obtained from density estimation, allows us to provide robust estimates of

sampling simulations from every possible starting state from a time far enough

considering every possible state is intractable for large networks, however. We
propose a method for layered noisy-or networks that uses a compact, but often

observation: Any (PO)MDP can be transformed into an ""equivalent"" POMDP in which
all state transitions (given the current state and action) are deterministic.
This reduces the general problem of policy search to one in which we need only
consider POMDPs with deterministic transitions. We give a natural way of
estimating the value of all policies in these transformed POMDPs. Policy search
is then simply performed by searching for a policy with high estimated value.
We also establish conditions under which our value estimates will be good,
recovering theoretical results similar to those of Kearns, Mansour and Ng
(1999), but with ""sample complexity"" bounds that have only a polynomial rather
than exponential dependence on the horizon time. Our method applies to

existence of hidden variables without exhaustive and expensive search. Our
approach is based on the observation that, in dynamic systems, ignoring a
hidden variable typically results in a violation of the Markov property. Thus,

an assessment of the agent's uncertainty about its current value estimates for

scales linearly with the size of the network. Leveraging the planar topology of
the graph, the method computes efficiently the time correlations between
neighboring streets. First, raw probe vehicle traces are compressed into pairs
of travel times and number of stops for each traversed road segment using a
`stop-and-go' algorithm developed for this work. The compressed data is then
used as input for training a path travel time model, which couples a Markov
model along with a Gaussian Markov random field. Finally, scalable inference
algorithms are developed for obtaining path travel time distributions from the
composite MM-GMRF model. We illustrate the accuracy and scalability of our
model on a 505,000 road link network spanning the San Francisco Bay Area.",2013-02-26T22:36:46Z,"Timothy Hunter, Aude Hofleitner, Jack Reilly, Walid Krichene, Jerome Thai, Anastasios Kouvelas, Pieter Abbeel, Alexandre Bayen"
1304.6383v2,"The Stochastic Gradient Descent for the Primal L1-SVM Optimization
  Revisited","We reconsider the stochastic (sub)gradient approach to the unconstrained
primal L1-SVM optimization. We observe that if the learning rate is inversely
proportional to the number of steps, i.e., the number of times any training
pattern is presented to the algorithm, the update rule may be transformed into
the one of the classical perceptron with margin in which the margin threshold
increases linearly with the number of steps. Moreover, if we cycle repeatedly
through the possibly randomly permuted training set the dual variables defined
naturally via the expansion of the weight vector as a linear combination of the
patterns on which margin errors were made are shown to obey at the end of each
complete cycle automatically the box constraints arising in dual optimization.
This renders the dual Lagrangian a running lower bound on the primal objective
tending to it at the optimum and makes available an upper bound on the relative
accuracy achieved which provides a meaningful stopping criterion. In addition,
we propose a mechanism of presenting the same pattern repeatedly to the
algorithm which maintains the above properties. Finally, we give experimental
evidence that algorithms constructed along these lines exhibit a considerably
improved performance.",2013-04-23T19:24:02Z,"Constantinos Panagiotakopoulos, Petroula Tsampouka"
1305.1679v1,High Level Pattern Classification via Tourist Walks in Networks,"Complex networks refer to large-scale graphs with nontrivial connection
patterns. The salient and interesting features that the complex network study
offer in comparison to graph theory are the emphasis on the dynamical
properties of the networks and the ability of inherently uncovering pattern
formation of the vertices. In this paper, we present a hybrid data
classification technique combining a low level and a high level classifier. The
low level term can be equipped with any traditional classification techniques,
which realize the classification task considering only physical features (e.g.,
geometrical or statistical features) of the input data. On the other hand, the
high level term has the ability of detecting data patterns with semantic
meanings. In this way, the classification is realized by means of the
extraction of the underlying network's features constructed from the input
data. As a result, the high level classification process measures the
compliance of the test instances with the pattern formation of the training
data. Out of various high level perspectives that can be utilized to capture
semantic meaning, we utilize the dynamical features that are generated from a
tourist walker in a networked environment. Specifically, a weighted combination
of transient and cycle lengths generated by the tourist walk is employed for
that end. Interestingly, our study shows that the proposed technique is able to
further improve the already optimized performance of traditional classification
techniques.",2013-05-07T23:40:08Z,"Thiago Christiano Silva, Liang Zhao"

Iteration (PI) scheme via an -approximate greedy operator (Kakade and Langford,

bounds for Direct Policy Iteration (DPI) (Lagoudakis and Parr, 2003; Fern et
al., 2006; Lazaric et al., 2010) and Conservative Policy Iteration (CPI)

concentrability constants involved in such guarantees, we notably argue that
the guarantee of CPI is much better than that of DPI, but this comes at the
cost of a relative--exponential in $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$-- increase of time
complexity. We then describe an algorithm, Non-Stationary Direct Policy
Iteration (NSDPI), that can either be seen as 1) a variation of Policy Search
by Dynamic Programming by Bagnell et al. (2003) to the infinite horizon
situation or 2) a simplified version of the Non-Stationary PI with growing

1306.2295v1,Markov random fields factorization with context-specific independences,"Markov random fields provide a compact representation of joint probability
distributions by representing its independence properties in an undirected

independences to factorize a Gibbs distribution into a set of factors. However,
an important issue of using a graph to represent independences is that it
cannot encode some types of independence relations, such as the
context-specific independences (CSIs). They are a particular case of
conditional independences that is true only for a certain assignment of its
conditioning set; in contrast to conditional independences that must hold for
all its assignments. This work presents a method for factorizing a Markov
random field according to CSIs present in a distribution, and formally

propagation is at least as fast as Shafer-Shenoy propagation and in the cases
that we have large vertices of high degree is significantly faster. However,

of both worlds: the speed of Hugin propagation and the low space requirements

The source subset forms an `$\epsilon$-net' over the original set of MDPs, in
the sense that for each previous MDP $M_p$, there is a source $M^s$ whose
optimal policy has $<\epsilon$ regret in $M_p$. Our contributions are as
follows. We present EXP-3-Transfer, a principled policy-reuse algorithm that

The framework consists of (i) a distance $d_V$ over MDPs to measure
policy-based similarity between MDPs; (ii) a cost function $g(\cdot)$ that uses

aggregation results by showing that even if the reduced process is not an MDP,
the (q-)value functions and (optimal) policies of an associated MDP with same
state-space size solve the original problem, as long as the solution can
approximately be represented as a function of the reduced states. This implies

  Data Problems","In the big data era, scalability has become a crucial requirement for any
useful computational model. Probabilistic graphical models are very useful for
mining and discovering data insights, but they are not scalable enough to be
suitable for big data problems. Bayesian Networks particularly demonstrate this
limitation when their data is represented using few random variables while each
random variable has a massive set of values. With hierarchical data - data that
is arranged in a treelike structure with several levels - one would expect to
see hundreds of thousands or millions of values distributed over even just a
small number of levels. When modeling this kind of hierarchical data across
large data sets, Bayesian networks become infeasible for representing the
probability distributions for the following reasons: i) Each level represents a
single random variable with hundreds of thousands of values, ii) The number of
levels is usually small, so there are also few random variables, and iii) The
structure of the network is predefined since the dependency is modeled top-down
from each parent to each of its child nodes, so the network would contain a
single linear path for the random variables from each parent to each child
node. In this paper we present a scalable probabilistic graphical model to
overcome these limitations for massive hierarchical data. We believe the
proposed model will lead to an easily-scalable, more readable, and expressive
implementation for problems that require probabilistic-based solutions for
massive amounts of hierarchical data. We successfully applied this model to

find optimal motifs. We treat the occurrence frequency as a function and
time-series motifs as its parameters, therefore we \textit{learn} the optimal

method is able to discover the most repetitive patterns (hence optimal), even

1510.06143v4,High Performance Latent Variable Models,"Latent variable models have accumulated a considerable amount of interest
from the industry and academia for their versatility in a wide range of
applications. A large amount of effort has been made to develop systems that is
able to extend the systems to a large scale, in the hope to make use of them on
industry scale data. In this paper, we describe a system that operates at a
scale orders of magnitude higher than previous works, and an order of magnitude
faster than state-of-the-art system at the same scale, at the same time showing
more robustness and more accurate results.
  Our system uses a number of advances in distributed inference: high
performance in synchronization of sufficient statistics with relaxed
consistency model; fast sampling, using the Metropolis-Hastings-Walker method
to overcome dense generative models; statistical modeling, moving beyond Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to Pitman-Yor distributions (PDP) and Hierarchical
Dirichlet Process (HDP) models; sophisticated parameter projection schemes, to
resolve the conflicts within the constraint between parameters arising from the
relaxed consistency model.
  This work significantly extends the domain of applicability of what is
commonly known as the Parameter Server. We obtain results with up to hundreds
billion oftokens, thousands of topics, and a vocabulary of a few million
token-types, using up to 60,000 processor cores operating on a production
cluster of a large Internet company. This demonstrates the feasibility to scale

1510.06335v2,"Time-Sensitive Bayesian Information Aggregation for Crowdsourcing
  Systems","Crowdsourcing systems commonly face the problem of aggregating multiple
judgments provided by potentially unreliable workers. In addition, several
aspects of the design of efficient crowdsourcing processes, such as defining
worker's bonuses, fair prices and time limits of the tasks, involve knowledge
of the likely duration of the task at hand. Bringing this together, in this
work we introduce a new time--sensitive Bayesian aggregation method that
simultaneously estimates a task's duration and obtains reliable aggregations of
crowdsourced judgments. Our method, called BCCTime, builds on the key insight
that the time taken by a worker to perform a task is an important indicator of
the likely quality of the produced judgment. To capture this, BCCTime uses
latent variables to represent the uncertainty about the workers' completion
time, the tasks' duration and the workers' accuracy. To relate the quality of a
judgment to the time a worker spends on a task, our model assumes that each
task is completed within a latent time window within which all workers with a
propensity to genuinely attempt the labelling task (i.e., no spammers) are
expected to submit their judgments. In contrast, workers with a lower
propensity to valid labeling, such as spammers, bots or lazy labelers, are
assumed to perform tasks considerably faster or slower than the time required
by normal workers. Specifically, we use efficient message-passing Bayesian
inference to learn approximate posterior probabilities of (i) the confusion
matrix of each worker, (ii) the propensity to valid labeling of each worker,
(iii) the unbiased duration of each task and (iv) the true label of each task.
Using two real-world public datasets for entity linking tasks, we show that
BCCTime produces up to 11% more accurate classifications and up to 100% more
informative estimates of a task's duration compared to state-of-the-art
methods.",2015-10-21T16:42:55Z,"Matteo Venanzi, John Guiver, Pushmeet Kohli, Nick Jennings"
1512.00165v1,Learning Using 1-Local Membership Queries,"Classic machine learning algorithms learn from labelled examples. For
example, to design a machine translation system, a typical training set will
consist of English sentences and their translation. There is a stronger model,
in which the algorithm can also query for labels of new examples it creates.
E.g, in the translation task, the algorithm can create a new English sentence,
and request its translation from the user during training. This combination of
examples and queries has been widely studied. Yet, despite many theoretical
results, query algorithms are almost never used. One of the main causes for
this is a report (Baum and Lang, 1992) on very disappointing empirical
performance of a query algorithm. These poor results were mainly attributed to
the fact that the algorithm queried for labels of examples that are artificial,
and impossible to interpret by humans.
  In this work we study a new model of local membership queries (Awasthi et
al., 2012), which tries to resolve the problem of artificial queries. In this
model, the algorithm is only allowed to query the labels of examples which are
close to examples from the training set. E.g., in translation, the algorithm
can change individual words in a sentence it has already seen, and then ask for
the translation. In this model, the examples queried by the algorithm will be
close to natural examples and hence, hopefully, will not appear as artificial
or random. We focus on 1-local queries (i.e., queries of distance 1 from an
example in the training sample). We show that 1-local membership queries are
already stronger than the standard learning model. We also present an
experiment on a well known NLP task of sentiment analysis. In this experiment,
the users were asked to provide more information than merely indicating the
label. We present results that illustrate that this extra information is
beneficial in practice.",2015-12-01T07:40:49Z,Galit Bary

mapping the output labels into the taxonomy is desirable to integrate the
effort spent in training the constituent classifiers. A hierarchical taxonomy
representing some domain knowledge may be different from, but partially
mappable to, the label sets of the individual classifiers. We present a
heuristic approach and a principled graphical model to aggregate the label
predictions by grounding them into the available taxonomy. Our model aggregates
the labels using the taxonomy structure as constraints to find the most likely
hierarchically consistent class. We experimentally validate our proposed method

sketch-based methods to approximate the distribution on labels per node thereby
achieving a space reduction from $O(m)$ to $O(\log m)$, under certain

the algorithm propagates labels accurately, and further reduces the space
complexity per node to $O(1)$. We also provide a distributed version of the
algorithm that scales well to large data sizes. Experiments on real-world

possible to significantly reduce the number of learning steps. When used in

choice of discretization policy has significant impact on the accuracy, speed,
and interpretability of the resulting models. This paper introduces a
principled Bayesian discretization method for continuous variables in Bayesian
networks with quadratic complexity instead of the cubic complexity of other
standard techniques. Empirical demonstrations show that the proposed method is

1512.04087v2,True Online Temporal-Difference Learning,"The temporal-difference methods TD($\lambda$) and Sarsa($\lambda$) form a
core part of modern reinforcement learning. Their appeal comes from their good
performance, low computational cost, and their simple interpretation, given by
their forward view. Recently, new versions of these methods were introduced,
called true online TD($\lambda$) and true online Sarsa($\lambda$), respectively
(van Seijen & Sutton, 2014). These new versions maintain an exact equivalence
with the forward view at all times, whereas the traditional versions only
approximate it for small step-sizes. We hypothesize that these true online
methods not only have better theoretical properties, but also dominate the
regular methods empirically. In this article, we put this hypothesis to the
test by performing an extensive empirical comparison. Specifically, we compare
the performance of true online TD($\lambda$)/Sarsa($\lambda$) with regular
TD($\lambda$)/Sarsa($\lambda$) on random MRPs, a real-world myoelectric
prosthetic arm, and a domain from the Arcade Learning Environment. We use
linear function approximation with tabular, binary, and non-binary features.
Our results suggest that the true online methods indeed dominate the regular
methods. Across all domains/representations the learning speed of the true
online methods are often better, but never worse than that of the regular
methods. An additional advantage is that no choice between traces has to be
made for the true online methods. Besides the empirical results, we provide an
in-depth analysis of the theory behind true online temporal-difference
learning. In addition, we show that new true online temporal-difference methods
can be derived by making changes to the online forward view and then rewriting

this local consistency leads to an increase in the action gap at each state;
increasing this gap, we argue, mitigates the undesirable effects of
approximation and estimation errors on the induced greedy policies. This
operator can also be applied to discretized continuous space and time problems,
and we provide empirical results evidencing superior performance in this
context. Extending the idea of a locally consistent operator, we then derive
sufficient conditions for an operator to preserve optimality, leading to a
family of operators which includes our consistent Bellman operator. As
corollaries we provide a proof of optimality for Baird's advantage learning
algorithm and derive other gap-increasing operators with interesting
properties. We conclude with an empirical study on 60 Atari 2600 games

learning algorithms. When the features do not properly describe the initial

internally changing the representation space, but the newly-constructed
features are rarely comprehensible. We seek to construct, in an unsupervised
way, new features that are more appropriate for describing a given dataset and,
at the same time, comprehensible for a human user. We propose two algorithms
that construct the new features as conjunctions of the initial primitive
features or their negations. The generated feature sets have reduced
correlations between features and succeed in catching some of the hidden
relations between individuals in a dataset. For example, a feature like $sky
\wedge \neg building \wedge panorama$ would be true for non-urban images and is
more informative than simple features expressing the presence or the absence of
an object. The notion of Pareto optimality is used to evaluate feature sets and
to obtain a balance between total correlation and the complexity of the
resulted feature set. Statistical hypothesis testing is used in order to
automatically determine the values of the parameters used for constructing a

1601.06180v2,On the Latent Variable Interpretation in Sum-Product Networks,"One of the central themes in Sum-Product networks (SPNs) is the
interpretation of sum nodes as marginalized latent variables (LVs). This
interpretation yields an increased syntactic or semantic structure, allows the
application of the EM algorithm and to efficiently perform MPE inference. In
literature, the LV interpretation was justified by explicitly introducing the
indicator variables corresponding to the LVs' states. However, as pointed out
in this paper, this approach is in conflict with the completeness condition in
SPNs and does not fully specify the probabilistic model. We propose a remedy
for this problem by modifying the original approach for introducing the LVs,
which we call SPN augmentation. We discuss conditional independencies in
augmented SPNs, formally establish the probabilistic interpretation of the
sum-weights and give an interpretation of augmented SPNs as Bayesian networks.
Based on these results, we find a sound derivation of the EM algorithm for
SPNs. Furthermore, the Viterbi-style algorithm for MPE proposed in literature
was never proven to be correct. We show that this is indeed a correct
algorithm, when applied to selective SPNs, and in particular when applied to

various attribute discovery methods such as PiCoDeS on two attribute datasets.
The evaluation shows that our approach is able to select the automatic

processes (PAC-MDP), much theoretical work has focused on methods to attain
near optimality after a relatively long period of learning and exploration.
However, practical concerns require the attainment of satisfactory behavior
within a short period of time. In this paper, we relax the PAC-MDP conditions
to reconcile theoretically driven exploration methods and practical needs. We
propose simple algorithms for discrete and continuous state spaces, and

predicts a student's future response given previous responses using two
publicly available and one proprietary data set. We find that IRT-based methods
consistently matched or outperformed DKT across all data sets at the finest
level of content granularity that was tractable for them to be trained on. A
hierarchical extension of IRT that captured item grouping structure performed
best overall. When data sets included non-trivial autocorrelations in student
response patterns, a temporal extension of IRT improved performance over
standard IRT while the RNN-based method did not. We conclude that IRT-based

a neural networks using the Levenderg-Marquardt algorithm, where we restricted
the knowledge dissemination in the network structure. This procedure reduces
neural network plasticity without drastically damaging the learning

explicitly designed for data stream applications that require to process a
virtually infinite sequence of data using constant memory and constant
processing time. Our method is composed of an online procedure used to
efficiently map text into a low-dimensional feature space and a partition of
this space into a set of regions for which the system extracts and keeps
statistics used to predict multi-label text annotations. Documents are fed into
the system as a sequence of words, mapped to a region of the partition, and
annotated using the statistics computed from the labelled instances colliding
in the same region. This approach is referred to as clashing. We illustrate the
method in real-world text data, comparing the results with those obtained using
other text classifiers. In addition, we provide an analysis about the effect of
the representation space dimensionality on the predictive performance of the
system. Our results show that the online embedding indeed approximates the
geometry of the full corpus-wise TF and TF-IDF space. The model obtains
competitive F measures with respect to the most accurate methods, using

that any sparse polynomial function can be computed, on nearly all sparse

the vector as input. Consequently, when a set of sparse binary vectors is
approximately separable using a sparse polynomial, there exists a single-layer
neural network that takes a short sketch as input and correctly classifies
nearly all the points. Previous work has proposed using sketches to reduce
dimensionality while preserving the hypothesis class. However, the sketch size
has an exponential dependence on the degree in the case of polynomial

a larger hypothesis class allows the sketch size to have a logarithmic
dependence on the degree. Even in the linear case, our approach allows us to

parameters of the latent state distribution are directly optimized as a
deterministic computation graph, resulting in a simple and effective gradient
descent algorithm for training discriminative state estimators. We show that
this procedure can be used to train state estimators that use complex input,
such as raw camera images, which must be processed using expressive nonlinear

viewed as a type of recurrent neural network, and the connection to
probabilistic filtering allows us to design a network architecture that is

an information-theoretic auxiliary function to track the progress of ECED, and
utilizes adaptive submodularity to attain the near-optimal bound. We

agent behaviour is typically random, often dithering aimlessly and lacking

purposeful behaviour in the absence of rewards. The algorithm proceeds by
constructing temporally extended actions (options), through the identification
of purposes that are ""just out of reach"" of the agent's current behaviour.
These purposes establish intrinsic goals for the agent to learn, ultimately

customers. We first split the area in which the customers are located into
grids of different sizes. For each grid cell we then compute the proportion of
inspected customers and the proportion of NTL found among the inspected
customers. We then analyze the distributions of features generated and show why
they are useful to predict NTL. In addition, we compute features from the

update the weights. Finally, we extend our model to transfer the experience

that uses a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model

has limitations when the goal is for generating sequences of discrete tokens. A
major reason lies in that the discrete outputs from the generative model make
it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the
generative model. Also, the discriminative model can only assess a complete
sequence, while for a partially generated sequence, it is non-trivial to
balance its current score and the future one once the entire sequence has been

SeqGAN, to solve the problems. Modeling the data generator as a stochastic
policy in reinforcement learning (RL), SeqGAN bypasses the generator
differentiation problem by directly performing gradient policy update. The RL

bear on the generic task of trial-and-error learning, and its effectiveness has
been convincingly demonstrated on tasks such as Atari video games and the game
of Go. However, contemporary DRL systems inherit a number of shortcomings from
the current generation of deep learning techniques. For example, they require
very large datasets to work effectively, entailing that they are slow to learn
even when such datasets are available. Moreover, they lack the ability to
reason on an abstract level, which makes it difficult to implement high-level
cognitive functions such as transfer learning, analogical reasoning, and
hypothesis-based reasoning. Finally, their operation is largely opaque to
humans, rendering them unsuitable for domains in which verifiability is
important. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning
architecture comprising a neural back end and a symbolic front end with the
potential to overcome each of these shortcomings. As proof-of-concept, we

several variants of a simple video game. We show that the resulting system --

  Deterministic Planning","A main focus of machine learning research has been improving the
generalization accuracy and efficiency of prediction models. Many models such
as SVM, random forest, and deep neural nets have been proposed and achieved
great success. However, what emerges as missing in many applications is
actionability, i.e., the ability to turn prediction results into actions. For
example, in applications such as customer relationship management, clinical
prediction, and advertisement, the users need not only accurate prediction, but
also actionable instructions which can transfer an input to a desirable goal
(e.g., higher profit repays, lower morbidity rates, higher ads hit rates).
Existing effort in deriving such actionable knowledge is few and limited to
simple action models which restricted to only change one attribute for each
action. The dilemma is that in many real applications those action models are
often more complex and harder to extract an optimal solution.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach that achieves actionability by
combining learning with planning, two core areas of AI. In particular, we
propose a framework to extract actionable knowledge from random forest, one of
the most widely used and best off-the-shelf classifiers. We formulate the
actionability problem to a sub-optimal action planning (SOAP) problem, which is
to find a plan to alter certain features of a given input so that the random
forest would yield a desirable output, while minimizing the total costs of
actions. Technically, the SOAP problem is formulated in the SAS+ planning
formalism, and solved using a Max-SAT based approach. Our experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach on a
personal credit dataset and other benchmarks. Our work represents a new
application of automated planning on an emerging and challenging machine

makes them difficult to learn and limits their applicability. Sum-product
networks are a class of deep models where, surprisingly, inference remains
tractable even when an arbitrary number of hidden layers are present. In this
paper, we generalize this result to a much broader set of learning problems:
all those where inference consists of summing a function over a semiring. This
includes satisfiability, constraint satisfaction, optimization, integration,
and others. In any semiring, for summation to be tractable it suffices that the
factors of every product have disjoint scopes. This unifies and extends many
previous results in the literature. Enforcing this condition at learning time
thus ensures that the learned models are tractable. We illustrate the power and
generality of this approach by applying it to a new type of structured
prediction problem: learning a nonconvex function that can be globally
optimized in polynomial time. We show empirically that this greatly outperforms

learning costs has long been studied in control and reinforcement learning (RL)
domains, typically for imitation learning from demonstrations. In these fields,
learning cost function underlying observed behavior is known as inverse
reinforcement learning (IRL) or inverse optimal control. While at first the
connection between cost learning in RL and cost learning in generative modeling
may appear to be a superficial one, we show in this paper that certain IRL
methods are in fact mathematically equivalent to GANs. In particular, we
demonstrate an equivalence between a sample-based algorithm for maximum entropy
IRL and a GAN in which the generator's density can be evaluated and is provided
as an additional input to the discriminator. Interestingly, maximum entropy IRL
is a special case of an energy-based model. We discuss the interpretation of
GANs as an algorithm for training energy-based models, and relate this
interpretation to other recent work that seeks to connect GANs and EBMs. By

thought that count-based methods cannot be applied in high-dimensional state
spaces, since most states will only occur once. Recent deep RL exploration
strategies are able to deal with high-dimensional continuous state spaces
through complex heuristics, often relying on optimism in the face of
uncertainty or intrinsic motivation. In this work, we describe a surprising
finding: a simple generalization of the classic count-based approach can reach
near state-of-the-art performance on various high-dimensional and/or continuous
deep RL benchmarks. States are mapped to hash codes, which allows to count
their occurrences with a hash table. These counts are then used to compute a
reward bonus according to the classic count-based exploration theory. We find
that simple hash functions can achieve surprisingly good results on many
challenging tasks. Furthermore, we show that a domain-dependent learned hash
code may further improve these results. Detailed analysis reveals important
aspects of a good hash function: 1) having appropriate granularity and 2)

sequence to help students learn knowledge concepts efficiently. However,
existing methods such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and Deep Knowledge Tracing
either model knowledge state for each predefined concept separately or fail to
pinpoint exactly which concepts a student is good at or unfamiliar with. To
solve these problems, this work introduces a new model called Dynamic Key-Value
Memory Networks (DKVMN) that can exploit the relationships between underlying
concepts and directly output a student's mastery level of each concept. Unlike
standard memory-augmented neural networks that facilitate a single memory
matrix or two static memory matrices, our model has one static matrix called
key, which stores the knowledge concepts and the other dynamic matrix called
value, which stores and updates the mastery levels of corresponding concepts.

1611.09321v3,Improving Policy Gradient by Exploring Under-appreciated Rewards,"This paper presents a novel form of policy gradient for model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) with improved exploration properties. Current
policy-based methods use entropy regularization to encourage undirected
exploration of the reward landscape, which is ineffective in high dimensional
spaces with sparse rewards. We propose a more directed exploration strategy
that promotes exploration of under-appreciated reward regions. An action
sequence is considered under-appreciated if its log-probability under the
current policy under-estimates its resulting reward. The proposed exploration
strategy is easy to implement, requiring small modifications to an
implementation of the REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the approach on a set of
algorithmic tasks that have long challenged RL methods. Our approach reduces
hyper-parameter sensitivity and demonstrates significant improvements over
baseline methods. Our algorithm successfully solves a benchmark multi-digit
addition task and generalizes to long sequences. This is, to our knowledge, the

with generic notions of objects and their interactions; realized as a neural
network, it can be trained via stochastic gradient descent to adapt to specific
object properties and dynamics of different worlds. We evaluate the efficacy of
our approach on simple rigid body dynamics in two-dimensional worlds. By
comparing to less structured architectures, we show that the NPE's

1612.03780v1,"Online Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Exploration in Continuous
  State and Action Markov Decision Processes","This paper presents a new method to learn online policies in continuous
state, continuous action, model-free Markov decision processes, with two
properties that are crucial for practical applications. First, the policies are
implementable with a very low computational cost: once the policy is computed,
the action corresponding to a given state is obtained in logarithmic time with
respect to the number of samples used. Second, our method is versatile: it does
not rely on any a priori knowledge of the structure of optimal policies. We
build upon the Fitted Q-iteration algorithm which represents the $Q$-value as
the average of several regression trees. Our algorithm, the Fitted Policy
Forest algorithm (FPF), computes a regression forest representing the Q-value
and transforms it into a single tree representing the policy, while keeping
control on the size of the policy using resampling and leaf merging. We
introduce an adaptation of Multi-Resolution Exploration (MRE) which is
particularly suited to FPF. We assess the performance of FPF on three classical
benchmarks for reinforcement learning: the ""Inverted Pendulum"", the ""Double
Integrator"" and ""Car on the Hill"" and show that FPF equals or outperforms other
algorithms, although these algorithms rely on the use of particular
representations of the policies, especially chosen in order to fit each of the
three problems. Finally, we exhibit that the combination of FPF and MRE allows
to find nearly optimal solutions in problems where $\epsilon$-greedy approaches

in time-oriented data. The Knowledge-Based Temporal Abstraction method was
previously proposed for intelligent interpretation of temporal data based on
predefined domain knowledge. In this study we propose a framework that
integrates the KBTA method with a temporal pattern mining process for anomaly

1612.05299v1,A Survey of Inductive Biases for Factorial Representation-Learning,"With the resurgence of interest in neural networks, representation learning
has re-emerged as a central focus in artificial intelligence. Representation
learning refers to the discovery of useful encodings of data that make
domain-relevant information explicit. Factorial representations identify
underlying independent causal factors of variation in data. A factorial
representation is compact and faithful, makes the causal factors explicit, and
facilitates human interpretation of data. Factorial representations support a
variety of applications, including the generation of novel examples, indexing
and search, novelty detection, and transfer learning.
  This article surveys various constraints that encourage a learning algorithm
to discover factorial representations. I dichotomize the constraints in terms
of unsupervised and supervised inductive bias. Unsupervised inductive biases
exploit assumptions about the environment, such as the statistical distribution
of factor coefficients, assumptions about the perturbations a factor should be
invariant to (e.g. a representation of an object can be invariant to rotation,
translation or scaling), and assumptions about how factors are combined to
synthesize an observation. Supervised inductive biases are constraints on the
representations based on additional information connected to observations.
Supervisory labels come in variety of types, which vary in how strongly they
constrain the representation, how many factors are labeled, how many
observations are labeled, and whether or not we know the associations between
the constraints and the factors they are related to.
  This survey brings together a wide variety of models that all touch on the
problem of learning factorial representations and lays out a framework for
comparing these models based on the strengths of the underlying supervised and
unsupervised inductive biases.",2016-12-15T22:55:41Z,Karl Ridgeway

Instead of grouping players together based on physical attributes and positions
played, analysts can group together players that play similar to each other
based on these tracked metrics. Existing methods for player classification have
typically used offensive metrics for clustering [1]. There have been attempts
to classify players using past defensive metrics, but the lack of quality

model to ""correct"" itself when it produces errors, substantially improving MBRL
with flawed models. This paper theoretically analyzes this approach,
illuminates settings in which it is likely to be effective or ineffective, and
presents a novel error bound, showing that a model's ability to self-correct is
more tightly related to MBRL performance than one-step prediction error. These

complexity. Furthermore, we show how both regularization to prevent overfitting

1612.07896v1,A Base Camp for Scaling AI,"Modern statistical machine learning (SML) methods share a major limitation
with the early approaches to AI: there is no scalable way to adapt them to new
domains. Human learning solves this in part by leveraging a rich, shared,
updateable world model. Such scalability requires modularity: updating part of
the world model should not impact unrelated parts. We have argued that such
modularity will require both ""correctability"" (so that errors can be corrected
without introducing new errors) and ""interpretability"" (so that we can
understand what components need correcting).
  To achieve this, one could attempt to adapt state of the art SML systems to
be interpretable and correctable; or one could see how far the simplest
possible interpretable, correctable learning methods can take us, and try to
control the limitations of SML methods by applying them only where needed. Here
we focus on the latter approach and we investigate two main ideas: ""Teacher
Assisted Learning"", which leverages crowd sourcing to learn language; and
""Factored Dialog Learning"", which factors the process of application
development into roles where the language competencies needed are isolated,
enabling non-experts to quickly create new applications.
  We test these ideas in an ""Automated Personal Assistant"" (APA) setting, with
two scenarios: that of detecting user intent from a user-APA dialog; and that
of creating a class of event reminder applications, where a non-expert
""teacher"" can then create specific apps. For the intent detection task, we use
a dataset of a thousand labeled utterances from user dialogs with Cortana, and
we show that our approach matches state of the art SML methods, but in addition
provides full transparency: the whole (editable) model can be summarized on one
human-readable page. For the reminder app task, we ran small user studies to
verify the efficacy of the approach.",2016-12-23T08:03:20Z,"C. J. C. Burges, T. Hart, Z. Yang, S. Cucerzan, R. W. White, A. Pastusiak, J. Lewis"
1702.03584v3,Similarity Preserving Representation Learning for Time Series Clustering,"A considerable amount of clustering algorithms take instance-feature matrices
as their inputs. As such, they cannot directly analyze time series data due to
its temporal nature, usually unequal lengths, and complex properties. This is a
great pity since many of these algorithms are effective, robust, efficient, and
easy to use. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing an efficient
representation learning framework that is able to convert a set of time series
with various lengths to an instance-feature matrix. In particular, we guarantee
that the pairwise similarities between time series are well preserved after the
transformation, thus the learned feature representation is particularly
suitable for the time series clustering task. Given a set of $n$ time series,
we first construct an $n\times n$ partially-observed similarity matrix by
randomly sampling $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ pairs of time series and computing
their pairwise similarities. We then propose an efficient algorithm that solves
a non-convex and NP-hard problem to learn new features based on the
partially-observed similarity matrix. By conducting extensive empirical
studies, we show that the proposed framework is more effective, efficient, and

1702.03767v2,Is Big Data Sufficient for a Reliable Detection of Non-Technical Losses?,"Non-technical losses (NTL) occur during the distribution of electricity in
power grids and include, but are not limited to, electricity theft and faulty
meters. In emerging countries, they may range up to 40% of the total
electricity distributed. In order to detect NTLs, machine learning methods are
used that learn irregular consumption patterns from customer data and
inspection results. The Big Data paradigm followed in modern machine learning
reflects the desire of deriving better conclusions from simply analyzing more
data, without the necessity of looking at theory and models. However, the
sample of inspected customers may be biased, i.e. it does not represent the
population of all customers. As a consequence, machine learning models trained
on these inspection results are biased as well and therefore lead to unreliable
predictions of whether customers cause NTL or not. In machine learning, this
issue is called covariate shift and has not been addressed in the literature on
NTL detection yet. In this work, we present a novel framework for quantifying
and visualizing covariate shift. We apply it to a commercial data set from
Brazil that consists of 3.6M customers and 820K inspection results. We show
that some features have a stronger covariate shift than others, making
predictions less reliable. In particular, previous inspections were focused on
certain neighborhoods or customer classes and that they were not sufficiently
spread among the population of customers. This framework is about to be

better generalization and interpretability, which proved to be useful for
applications in many domains. In this paper, we consider a formulation of
multitask learning that learns the relationships both between tasks and between
features, represented through a task covariance and a feature covariance
matrix, respectively. First, we demonstrate that existing methods proposed for
this problem present an issue that may lead to ill-posed optimization. We then
propose an alternative formulation, as well as an efficient algorithm to
optimize it. Using ideas from optimization and graph theory, we propose an
efficient coordinate-wise minimization algorithm that has a closed form

1702.04767v2,Linear Time Computation of Moments in Sum-Product Networks,"Bayesian online algorithms for Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) need to update
their posterior distribution after seeing one single additional instance. To do
so, they must compute moments of the model parameters under this distribution.
The best existing method for computing such moments scales quadratically in the
size of the SPN, although it scales linearly for trees. This unfortunate
scaling makes Bayesian online algorithms prohibitively expensive, except for
small or tree-structured SPNs. We propose an optimal linear-time algorithm that
works even when the SPN is a general directed acyclic graph (DAG), which
significantly broadens the applicability of Bayesian online algorithms for
SPNs. There are three key ingredients in the design and analysis of our
algorithm: 1). For each edge in the graph, we construct a linear time reduction
from the moment computation problem to a joint inference problem in SPNs. 2).
Using the property that each SPN computes a multilinear polynomial, we give an
efficient procedure for polynomial evaluation by differentiation without
expanding the network that may contain exponentially many monomials. 3). We
propose a dynamic programming method to further reduce the computation of the
moments of all the edges in the graph from quadratic to linear. We demonstrate

high dimension this separation could be achieved with probability close to one
by linear discriminants. Surprisingly, separation of a new image from a very
large set of known images is almost always possible even in moderately high
dimensions by linear functionals, and coefficients of these functionals can be
found explicitly. Based on fundamental properties of measure concentration, we
show that for $M<a\exp(b{n})$ random $M$-element sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are
linearly separable with probability $p$, $p>1-\vartheta$, where $1>\vartheta>0$

1703.01327v2,Multi-step Reinforcement Learning: A Unifying Algorithm,"Unifying seemingly disparate algorithmic ideas to produce better performing
algorithms has been a longstanding goal in reinforcement learning. As a primary
example, TD($\lambda$) elegantly unifies one-step TD prediction with Monte
Carlo methods through the use of eligibility traces and the trace-decay
parameter $\lambda$. Currently, there are a multitude of algorithms that can be
used to perform TD control, including Sarsa, $Q$-learning, and Expected Sarsa.
These methods are often studied in the one-step case, but they can be extended
across multiple time steps to achieve better performance. Each of these
algorithms is seemingly distinct, and no one dominates the others for all
problems. In this paper, we study a new multi-step action-value algorithm
called $Q(\sigma)$ which unifies and generalizes these existing algorithms,
while subsuming them as special cases. A new parameter, $\sigma$, is introduced
to allow the degree of sampling performed by the algorithm at each step during
its backup to be continuously varied, with Sarsa existing at one extreme (full
sampling), and Expected Sarsa existing at the other (pure expectation).
$Q(\sigma)$ is generally applicable to both on- and off-policy learning, but in
this work we focus on experiments in the on-policy case. Our results show that
an intermediate value of $\sigma$, which results in a mixture of the existing
algorithms, performs better than either extreme. The mixture can also be varied
dynamically which can result in even greater performance.",2017-03-03T20:19:08Z,"Kristopher De Asis, J. Fernando Hernandez-Garcia, G. Zacharias Holland, Richard S. Sutton"

Moreover, it is also a usual case that only partial labels are observed, which
makes the exploitation of the label correlations much more difficult. That is,
it is hard to estimate the label correlations when many labels are absent. In

massively accelerate the learning process even from relatively small amounts of

to yield important insight with respect to the underlying dynamics, e.g. with
respect to user behaviour. However, predictive techniques in the past have
almost exclusively focused on single edges or nodes. In this contribution, we
attempt to predict the future state of a graph as a whole. We propose to phrase
time series prediction as a regression problem and apply dissimilarity- or
kernel-based regression techniques, such as 1-nearest neighbor, kernel
regression and Gaussian process regression, which can be applied to graphs via
graph kernels. The output of the regression is a point embedded in a
pseudo-Euclidean space, which can be analyzed using subsequent dissimilarity-
or kernel-based processing methods. We discuss strategies to speed up Gaussian
Processes regression from cubic to linear time and evaluate our approach on two
well-established theoretical models of graph evolution as well as two real data
sets from the domain of intelligent tutoring systems. We find that simple

with respect to the easier examples, which might require much less computation.
For an agent with a limited computational budget, this ""one-size-fits-all""
approach may result in the agent wasting valuable computation on easy examples,
while not spending enough on hard examples. Rather than learning a single,
fixed policy for solving all instances of a task, we introduce a metacontroller
which learns to optimize a sequence of ""imagined"" internal simulations over
predictive models of the world in order to construct a more informed, and more
economical, solution. The metacontroller component is a model-free
reinforcement learning agent, which decides both how many iterations of the
optimization procedure to run, as well as which model to consult on each
iteration. The models (which we call ""experts"") can be state transition models,
action-value functions, or any other mechanism that provides information useful
for solving the task, and can be learned on-policy or off-policy in parallel

the on-policy case. In both our on-policy and off-policy experiments, we found
that each method converged to a characteristic asymptotic level of error, with
ETD better than TD(0). TD(0) achieved a still lower error level temporarily

various extensions of ensemble learning for mining non-stationary data streams
can be found in the literature, most of them are crafted under a static base
classifier and revisits preceding samples in the sliding window for a
retraining step. This feature causes computationally prohibitive complexity and
is not flexible enough to cope with rapidly changing environments. Their
complexities are often demanding because it involves a large collection of
offline classifiers due to the absence of structural complexities reduction
mechanisms and lack of an online feature selection mechanism. A novel evolving
ensemble classifier, namely Parsimonious Ensemble pENsemble, is proposed in
this paper. pENsemble differs from existing architectures in the fact that it
is built upon an evolving classifier from data streams, termed Parsimonious
Classifier pClass. pENsemble is equipped by an ensemble pruning mechanism,
which estimates a localized generalization error of a base classifier. A
dynamic online feature selection scenario is integrated into the pENsemble.
This method allows for dynamic selection and deselection of input features on
the fly. pENsemble adopts a dynamic ensemble structure to output a final
classification decision where it features a novel drift detection scenario to
grow the ensemble structure. The efficacy of the pENsemble has been numerically

1705.06769v2,"Feature Control as Intrinsic Motivation for Hierarchical Reinforcement
  Learning","The problem of sparse rewards is one of the hardest challenges in
contemporary reinforcement learning. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)
tackles this problem by using a set of temporally-extended actions, or options,
each of which has its own subgoal. These subgoals are normally handcrafted for
specific tasks. Here, though, we introduce a generic class of subgoals with
broad applicability in the visual domain. Underlying our approach (in common
with work using ""auxiliary tasks"") is the hypothesis that the ability to
control aspects of the environment is an inherently useful skill to have. We
incorporate such subgoals in an end-to-end hierarchical reinforcement learning
system and test two variants of our algorithm on a number of games from the
Atari suite. We highlight the advantage of our approach in one of the hardest
games -- Montezuma's revenge -- for which the ability to handle sparse rewards
is key. Our agent learns several times faster than the current state-of-the-art
HRL agent in this game, reaching a similar level of performance. UPDATE
22/11/17: We found that a standard A3C agent with a simple shaped reward, i.e.
extrinsic reward + feature control intrinsic reward, has comparable performance
to our agent in Montezuma Revenge. In light of the new experiments performed,
the advantage of our HRL approach can be attributed more to its ability to

1705.07269v1,"Learning to Factor Policies and Action-Value Functions: Factored Action
  Space Representations for Deep Reinforcement learning","Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods have performed well in an
increasing numbering of high-dimensional visual decision making domains. Among
all such visual decision making problems, those with discrete action spaces
often tend to have underlying compositional structure in the said action space.
Such action spaces often contain actions such as go left, go up as well as go
diagonally up and left (which is a composition of the former two actions). The
representations of control policies in such domains have traditionally been
modeled without exploiting this inherent compositional structure in the action
spaces. We propose a new learning paradigm, Factored Action space
Representations (FAR) wherein we decompose a control policy learned using a
Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm into independent components, analogous to
decomposing a vector in terms of some orthogonal basis vectors. This
architectural modification of the control policy representation allows the
agent to learn about multiple actions simultaneously, while executing only one
of them. We demonstrate that FAR yields considerable improvements on top of two
DRL algorithms in Atari 2600: FARA3C outperforms A3C (Asynchronous Advantage
Actor Critic) in 9 out of 14 tasks and FARAQL outperforms AQL (Asynchronous

1705.07445v2,"Learning to Mix n-Step Returns: Generalizing lambda-Returns for Deep
  Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning (RL) can model complex behavior policies for
goal-directed sequential decision making tasks. A hallmark of RL algorithms is
Temporal Difference (TD) learning: value function for the current state is
moved towards a bootstrapped target that is estimated using next state's value
function. $\lambda$-returns generalize beyond 1-step returns and strike a
balance between Monte Carlo and TD learning methods. While lambda-returns have
been extensively studied in RL, they haven't been explored a lot in Deep RL.
This paper's first contribution is an exhaustive benchmarking of
lambda-returns. Although mathematically tractable, the use of exponentially
decaying weighting of n-step returns based targets in lambda-returns is a
rather ad-hoc design choice. Our second major contribution is that we propose a
generalization of lambda-returns called Confidence-based Autodidactic Returns
(CAR), wherein the RL agent learns the weighting of the n-step returns in an
end-to-end manner. This allows the agent to learn to decide how much it wants
to weigh the n-step returns based targets. In contrast, lambda-returns restrict
RL agents to use an exponentially decaying weighting scheme. Autodidactic
returns can be used for improving any RL algorithm which uses TD learning. We
empirically demonstrate that using sophisticated weighted mixtures of
multi-step returns (like CAR and lambda-returns) considerably outperforms the
use of n-step returns. We perform our experiments on the Asynchronous Advantage
Actor Critic (A3C) algorithm in the Atari 2600 domain.",2017-05-21T12:47:37Z,"Sahil Sharma, Girish Raguvir J, Srivatsan Ramesh, Balaraman Ravindran"
1705.08439v4,Thinking Fast and Slow with Deep Learning and Tree Search,"Sequential decision making problems, such as structured prediction, robotic

(ExIt), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm which decomposes the problem
into separate planning and generalisation tasks. Planning new policies is
performed by tree search, while a deep neural network generalises those plans.
Subsequently, tree search is improved by using the neural network policy to
guide search, increasing the strength of new plans. In contrast, standard deep
Reinforcement Learning algorithms rely on a neural network not only to
generalise plans, but to discover them too. We show that ExIt outperforms

needed, to grant the desired risk (with high probability). Empirical results
over CIFAR and ImageNet convincingly demonstrate the viability of our method,

of the prior over parameters. This provides us a very general way to
interpolate between generative and discriminative extremes through different
choices of priors. By maximizing both the marginal and the conditional
log-likelihoods, models derived from this framework can use both labeled
instances from the source domain as well as unlabeled instances from both
source and target domains. Under this framework, we show that the popular
reconstruction loss of autoencoder corresponds to an upper bound of the
negative marginal log-likelihoods of unlabeled instances, where marginal
distributions are given by proper kernel density estimations. This provides a
way to interpret the empirical success of autoencoders in domain adaptation and
semi-supervised learning. We instantiate our framework using neural networks,
and build a concrete model, DAuto. Empirically, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of DAuto on text, image and speech datasets, showing that it

field of artificial intelligence. Thanks to a large number of applications like
predicting abnormal events, navigation system for the blind, etc. there have
been many approaches to attempt learning patterns of motion directly from data
using a wide variety of techniques ranging from hand-crafted features to
sophisticated deep learning models for unsupervised feature learning. All these
approaches have been limited by problems like inefficient features in the case
of hand crafted features, large error propagation across the predicted
trajectory and no information of static artefacts around the dynamic moving
objects. We propose an end to end deep learning model to learn the motion
patterns of humans using different navigational modes directly from data using
the much popular sequence to sequence model coupled with a soft attention
mechanism. We also propose a novel approach to model the static artefacts in a
scene and using these to predict the dynamic trajectories. The proposed method,
tested on trajectories of pedestrians, consistently outperforms previously
proposed state of the art approaches on a variety of large scale data sets. We
also show how our architecture can be naturally extended to handle multiple

a user is addicted to an artist, s/he chooses the artist's songs regardless of

model to analyze people's music listening behavior. Our main contributions are
three-fold. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
modeling music listening behavior by taking into account the influence of
addiction to artists. Second, by using real-world datasets of play logs, we
showed the effectiveness of our proposed model. Third, we carried out
qualitative experiments and showed that taking addiction into account enables
us to analyze music listening behavior from a new viewpoint in terms of how

1705.09922v1,"Bayesian Unification of Gradient and Bandit-based Learning for
  Accelerated Global Optimisation","Bandit based optimisation has a remarkable advantage over gradient based
approaches due to their global perspective, which eliminates the danger of
getting stuck at local optima. However, for continuous optimisation problems or
problems with a large number of actions, bandit based approaches can be
hindered by slow learning. Gradient based approaches, on the other hand,
navigate quickly in high-dimensional continuous spaces through local
optimisation, following the gradient in fine grained steps. Yet, apart from
being susceptible to local optima, these schemes are less suited for online
learning due to their reliance on extensive trial-and-error before the optimum
can be identified. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach that unifies
the above two paradigms in one single framework, with the aim of combining
their advantages. At the heart of our approach we find a stochastic linear
approximation of the function to be optimised, where both the gradient and
values of the function are explicitly captured. This allows us to learn from
both noisy function and gradient observations, and predict these properties
across the action space to support optimisation. We further propose an
accompanying bandit driven exploration scheme that uses Bayesian credible
bounds to trade off exploration against exploitation. Our empirical results
demonstrate that by unifying bandit and gradient based learning, one obtains
consistently improved performance across a wide spectrum of problem
environments. Furthermore, even when gradient feedback is unavailable, the
flexibility of our model, including gradient prediction, still allows us
outperform competing approaches, although with a smaller margin. Due to the
pervasiveness of bandit based optimisation, our scheme opens up for improved
performance both in meta-optimisation and in applications where gradient
related information is readily available.",2017-05-28T09:55:11Z,Ole-Christoffer Granmo

settings of komi, a compensation given to balance the initiative of playing
first. The ML value network has three advantages, (a) it outputs values for
different komi, (b) it supports dynamic komi, and (c) it lowers the mean
squared error (MSE). This paper also proposes a new dynamic komi method to
improve game-playing strength. This paper also performs experiments to
demonstrate the merits of the architecture. First, the MSE of the ML value
network is generally lower than the value network alone. Second, the program
based on the ML value network wins by a rate of 67.6% against the program based
on the value network alone. Third, the program with the proposed dynamic komi
method significantly improves the playing strength over the baseline that does
not use dynamic komi, especially for handicap games. To our knowledge, up to

discrete non-linear models.
  We show that hierarchical dependencies between targets can be exploited by
enforcing an appropriate curriculum using hierarchical loss functions. On

Feedforward Boolean Networks (FBNs) trained with such a loss function achieve
significantly lower out-of-sample error, up to $10\%$ in some cases. This

time of the predicted placements is then used as the reward signal to optimize

limited data and restricted computational resources. But there is a more
fundamental question: is the problem of inferring a probabilistic model from a
sample possible even in principle? We explore this question and find some
surprisingly positive and general results. First, for a broad class of
probability distributions characterised by computability restrictions, we
specify a learning algorithm that will almost surely identify a probability
distribution in the limit given a finite i.i.d. sample of sufficient but
unknown length. This is similarly shown to hold for sequences generated by a
broad class of Markov chains, subject to computability assumptions. The
technical tool is the strong law of large numbers. Second, for a large class of
dependent sequences, we specify an algorithm which identifies in the limit a
computable measure for which the sequence is typical, in the sense of
Martin-Lof (there may be more than one such measure). The technical tool is the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We analyse the associated predictions in both

  Neighbor Classifier -- A Review","The K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier is one of the simplest and most
common classifiers, yet its performance competes with the most complex
classifiers in the literature. The core of this classifier depends mainly on
measuring the distance or similarity between the tested examples and the
training examples. This raises a major question about which distance measures
to be used for the KNN classifier among a large number of distance and
similarity measures available? This review attempts to answer this question
through evaluating the performance (measured by accuracy, precision and recall)
of the KNN using a large number of distance measures, tested on a number of
real-world datasets, with and without adding different levels of noise. The
experimental results show that the performance of KNN classifier depends
significantly on the distance used, and the results showed large gaps between
the performances of different distances. We found that a recently proposed
non-convex distance performed the best when applied on most datasets comparing
to the other tested distances. In addition, the performance of the KNN with
this top performing distance degraded only about $20\%$ while the noise level
reaches $90\%$, this is true for most of the distances used as well. This means
that the KNN classifier using any of the top $10$ distances tolerate noise to a
certain degree. Moreover, the results show that some distances are less
affected by the added noise comparing to other distances.",2017-08-14T20:52:35Z,"V. B. Surya Prasath, Haneen Arafat Abu Alfeilat, Ahmad B. A. Hassanat, Omar Lasassmeh, Ahmad S. Tarawneh, Mahmoud Bashir Alhasanat, Hamzeh S. Eyal Salman"
1708.04782v1,StarCraft II: A New Challenge for Reinforcement Learning,"This paper introduces SC2LE (StarCraft II Learning Environment), a
reinforcement learning environment based on the StarCraft II game. This domain
poses a new grand challenge for reinforcement learning, representing a more
difficult class of problems than considered in most prior work. It is a
multi-agent problem with multiple players interacting; there is imperfect
information due to a partially observed map; it has a large action space
involving the selection and control of hundreds of units; it has a large state
space that must be observed solely from raw input feature planes; and it has
delayed credit assignment requiring long-term strategies over thousands of
steps. We describe the observation, action, and reward specification for the
StarCraft II domain and provide an open source Python-based interface for
communicating with the game engine. In addition to the main game maps, we
provide a suite of mini-games focusing on different elements of StarCraft II
gameplay. For the main game maps, we also provide an accompanying dataset of
game replay data from human expert players. We give initial baseline results
for neural networks trained from this data to predict game outcomes and player
actions. Finally, we present initial baseline results for canonical deep
reinforcement learning agents applied to the StarCraft II domain. On the
mini-games, these agents learn to achieve a level of play that is comparable to
a novice player. However, when trained on the main game, these agents are

  Balancing","This work considers the trade-off between accuracy and test-time
computational cost of deep neural networks (DNNs) via \emph{anytime}

losses jointly in an \emph{adaptive} weighted sum, where the weights are
inversely proportional to average of each loss. Intuitively, this balances the
losses to have the same scale. We demonstrate theoretical considerations that
motivate this approach from multiple viewpoints, including connecting it to
optimizing the geometric mean of the expectation of each loss, an objective
that ignores the scale of losses. Experimentally, the adaptive weights induce
more competitive anytime predictions on multiple recognition data-sets and
models than non-adaptive approaches including weighing all losses equally. In
particular, anytime neural networks (ANNs) can achieve the same accuracy faster
using adaptive weights on a small network than using static constant weights on
a large one. For problems with high performance saturation, we also show a
sequence of exponentially deepening ANNscan achieve near-optimal anytime

  Prediction","Traffic speed is a key indicator for the efficiency of an urban
transportation system. Accurate modeling of the spatiotemporally varying
traffic speed thus plays a crucial role in urban planning and development. This
paper addresses the problem of efficient fine-grained traffic speed prediction
using big traffic data obtained from static sensors. Gaussian processes (GPs)
have been previously used to model various traffic phenomena, including flow
and speed. However, GPs do not scale with big traffic data due to their cubic
time complexity. In this work, we address their efficiency issues by proposing
local GPs to learn from and make predictions for correlated subsets of data.
The main idea is to quickly group speed variables in both spatial and temporal
dimensions into a finite number of clusters, so that future and unobserved
traffic speed queries can be heuristically mapped to one of such clusters. A
local GP corresponding to that cluster can then be trained on the fly to make
predictions in real-time. We call this method localization. We use non-negative
matrix factorization for localization and propose simple heuristics for cluster
mapping. We additionally leverage on the expressiveness of GP kernel functions
to model road network topology and incorporate side information. Extensive
experiments using real-world traffic data collected in the two U.S. cities of

1710.05219v1,Mental Sampling in Multimodal Representations,"Both resources in the natural environment and concepts in a semantic space
are distributed ""patchily"", with large gaps in between the patches. To describe
people's internal and external foraging behavior, various random walk models
have been proposed. In particular, internal foraging has been modeled as
sampling: in order to gather relevant information for making a decision, people
draw samples from a mental representation using random-walk algorithms such as
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). However, two common empirical observations
argue against simple sampling algorithms such as MCMC. First, the spatial
structure is often best described by a L\'evy flight distribution: the
probability of the distance between two successive locations follows a
power-law on the distances. Second, the temporal structure of the sampling that
humans and other animals produce have long-range, slowly decaying serial
correlations characterized as $1/f$-like fluctuations. We propose that mental
sampling is not done by simple MCMC, but is instead adapted to multimodal
representations and is implemented by Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MC$^3$), one of the first algorithms developed for sampling from
multimodal distributions. MC$^3$ involves running multiple Markov chains in
parallel but with target distributions of different temperatures, and it swaps
the states of the chains whenever a better location is found. Heated chains
more readily traverse valleys in the probability landscape to propose moves to
far-away peaks, while the colder chains make the local steps that explore the
current peak or patch. We show that MC$^3$ generates distances between
successive samples that follow a L\'evy flight distribution and $1/f$-like
serial correlations, providing a single mechanistic account of these two
puzzling empirical phenomena.",2017-10-14T18:17:30Z,"Jian-Qiao Zhu, Adam N. Sanborn, Nick Chater"

Specifically, we look at eigenoptions, options obtained from representations
that encode diffusive information flow in the environment. We extend the
existing algorithms for eigenoption discovery to settings with stochastic
transitions and in which handcrafted features are not available. We propose an
algorithm that discovers eigenoptions while learning non-linear state

learning input-output data, but by learning algorithms through a solving
procedure that obtains the output as a sequence of tasks for a given input
problem. The LSP neural network system not only learns simple problems of

batch approaches which cannot cope with a fast sampling rate of metal cutting
process. Furthermore they require a retraining process to be completed from

specific training scenarios, and make sure that the reward will lead to the
right behavior in those scenarios. Inevitably, agents encounter new scenarios
(e.g., new types of terrain) where optimizing that same reward may lead to
undesired behavior. Our insight is that reward functions are merely
observations about what the designer actually wants, and that they should be
interpreted in the context in which they were designed. We introduce inverse
reward design (IRD) as the problem of inferring the true objective based on the
designed reward and the training MDP. We introduce approximate methods for
solving IRD problems, and use their solution to plan risk-averse behavior in

1711.05255v1,"Deep-ESN: A Multiple Projection-encoding Hierarchical Reservoir
  Computing Framework","As an efficient recurrent neural network (RNN) model, reservoir computing
(RC) models, such as Echo State Networks, have attracted widespread attention
in the last decade. However, while they have had great success with time series
data [1], [2], many time series have a multiscale structure, which a
single-hidden-layer RC model may have difficulty capturing. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical reservoir computing framework we call Deep Echo
State Networks (Deep-ESNs). The most distinctive feature of a Deep-ESN is its
ability to deal with time series through hierarchical projections.
Specifically, when an input time series is projected into the high-dimensional
echo-state space of a reservoir, a subsequent encoding layer (e.g., a PCA,
autoencoder, or a random projection) can project the echo-state representations
into a lower-dimensional space. These low-dimensional representations can then
be processed by another ESN. By using projection layers and encoding layers
alternately in the hierarchical framework, a Deep-ESN can not only attenuate
the effects of the collinearity problem in ESNs, but also fully take advantage
of the temporal kernel property of ESNs to explore multiscale dynamics of time
series. To fuse the multiscale representations obtained by each reservoir, we
add connections from each encoding layer to the last output layer. Theoretical
analyses prove that stability of a Deep-ESN is guaranteed by the echo state
property (ESP), and the time complexity is equivalent to a conventional ESN.
Experimental results on some artificial and real world time series demonstrate
that Deep-ESNs can capture multiscale dynamics, and outperform both standard

theoretical properties of episodic control are not well investigated. Here I
show that in deterministic tree Markov decision processes, episodic control is
equivalent to a form of prioritized sweeping in terms of sample efficiency as
well as memory and computation demands. For general deterministic and
stochastic environments, prioritized sweeping performs better even when memory
and computation demands are restricted to be equal to those of episodic

1711.07875v2,Constructive Preference Elicitation over Hybrid Combinatorial Spaces,"Preference elicitation is the task of suggesting a highly preferred
configuration to a decision maker. The preferences are typically learned by
querying the user for choice feedback over pairs or sets of objects. In its
constructive variant, new objects are synthesized ""from scratch"" by maximizing
an estimate of the user utility over a combinatorial (possibly infinite) space
of candidates. In the constructive setting, most existing elicitation
techniques fail because they rely on exhaustive enumeration of the candidates.
A previous solution explicitly designed for constructive tasks comes with no
formal performance guarantees, and can be very expensive in (or unapplicable
to) problems with non-Boolean attributes. We propose the Choice Perceptron, a
Perceptron-like algorithm for learning user preferences from set-wise choice
feedback over constructive domains and hybrid Boolean-numeric feature spaces.
We provide a theoretical analysis on the attained regret that holds for a large
class of query selection strategies, and devise a heuristic strategy that aims
at optimizing the regret in practice. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness

of poor generalization, requiring a carefully handcrafted model of the system
dynamics for each task. Recently, hybrid methods have been successful in
trading off applicability for improved sample-complexity. However, these have
been limited to continuous action spaces. In this work, we present a new hybrid
method based on an approximation of the dynamics as an expectation over the
next state under the current policy. This relaxation allows us to derive a
novel hybrid policy gradient estimator, combining score function and pathwise
derivative estimators, that is applicable to discrete action spaces. We show
significant gains in sample complexity, ranging between $1.7$ and $25\times$,

control of actions via discretization. In this paper, we propose a novel neural
architecture featuring a shared decision module followed by several network
branches, one for each action dimension. This approach achieves a linear
increase of the number of network outputs with the number of degrees of freedom
by allowing a level of independence for each individual action dimension. To
illustrate the approach, we present a novel agent, called Branching Dueling
Q-Network (BDQ), as a branching variant of the Dueling Double Deep Q-Network

challenging continuous control tasks. The empirical results show that the
proposed agent scales gracefully to environments with increasing action

reinforcement learning due to their efficiency and simple implementation, their
Bayesian counterparts have not been utilized as frequently. One reason is that
the non-linear max operation in the Bellman optimality equation makes it
difficult to define conjugate distributions over the value functions. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Bayesian approach to off-policy TD methods, called
as ADFQ, which updates beliefs on state-action values, Q, through an online
Bayesian inference method known as Assumed Density Filtering. We formulate an
efficient closed-form solution for the value update by approximately estimating
analytic parameters of the posterior of the Q-beliefs. Uncertainty measures in
the beliefs not only are used in exploration but also provide a natural
regularization for the value update considering all next available actions.
ADFQ converges to Q-learning as the uncertainty measures of the Q-beliefs
decrease and improves common drawbacks of other Bayesian RL algorithms such as
computational complexity. We extend ADFQ with a neural network. Our empirical

1) infrastructure metrics, 2) data relevance metrics, and 3) application

the gradient and Hessian of the smoothed Q-value function. Based on these
relationships, we develop new algorithms for training a Gaussian policy
directly from a learned smoothed Q-value approximator. The approach is
additionally amenable to proximal optimization by augmenting the objective with

role of teaching, and pays most attention to machine \emph{learning}. In this
paper, we argue that equal attention, if not more, should be paid to teaching,

student model (which corresponds to the learner in traditional machine learning
algorithms), and a teacher model (which determines the appropriate data, loss
function, and hypothesis space to facilitate the training of the student
model). The teacher model leverages the feedback from the student model to
optimize its own teaching strategies by means of reinforcement learning, so as
to achieve teacher-student co-evolution. To demonstrate the practical value of
our proposed approach, we take the training of deep neural networks (DNN) as an

1805.04220v1,Human-Machine Collaborative Optimization via Apprenticeship Scheduling,"Coordinating agents to complete a set of tasks with intercoupled temporal and
resource constraints is computationally challenging, yet human domain experts
can solve these difficult scheduling problems using paradigms learned through
years of apprenticeship. A process for manually codifying this domain knowledge
within a computational framework is necessary to scale beyond the
``single-expert, single-trainee"" apprenticeship model. However, human domain
experts often have difficulty describing their decision-making processes,
causing the codification of this knowledge to become laborious. We propose a
new approach for capturing domain-expert heuristics through a pairwise ranking
formulation. Our approach is model-free and does not require enumerating or
iterating through a large state space. We empirically demonstrate that this
approach accurately learns multifaceted heuristics on a synthetic data set
incorporating job-shop scheduling and vehicle routing problems, as well as on
two real-world data sets consisting of demonstrations of experts solving a
weapon-to-target assignment problem and a hospital resource allocation problem.
We also demonstrate that policies learned from human scheduling demonstration
via apprenticeship learning can substantially improve the efficiency of a
branch-and-bound search for an optimal schedule. We employ this human-machine
collaborative optimization technique on a variant of the weapon-to-target
assignment problem. We demonstrate that this technique generates solutions
substantially superior to those produced by human domain experts at a rate up
to 9.5 times faster than an optimization approach and can be applied to
optimally solve problems twice as complex as those solved by a human
demonstrator.",2018-05-11T01:53:05Z,"Matthew Gombolay, Reed Jensen, Jessica Stigile, Toni Golen, Neel Shah, Sung-Hyun Son, Julie Shah"
1805.04748v1,"Towards Autonomous Reinforcement Learning: Automatic Setting of
  Hyper-parameters using Bayesian Optimization","With the increase of machine learning usage by industries and scientific
communities in a variety of tasks such as text mining, image recognition and
self-driving cars, automatic setting of hyper-parameter in learning algorithms
is a key factor for achieving satisfactory performance regardless of user
expertise in the inner workings of the techniques and methodologies. In
particular, for a reinforcement learning algorithm, the efficiency of an agent
learning a control policy in an uncertain environment is heavily dependent on
the hyper-parameters used to balance exploration with exploitation. In this
work, an autonomous learning framework that integrates Bayesian optimization
with Gaussian process regression to optimize the hyper-parameters of a
reinforcement learning algorithm, is proposed. Also, a bandits-based approach
to achieve a balance between computational costs and decreasing uncertainty
about the Q-values, is presented. A gridworld example is used to highlight how
hyper-parameter configurations of a learning algorithm (SARSA) are iteratively
improved based on two performance functions.",2018-05-12T16:42:55Z,"Juan Cruz Barsce, Jorge A. Palombarini, Ernesto C. Martínez"
1805.05769v1,"Leveraging human knowledge in tabular reinforcement learning: A study of
  human subjects","Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be extremely effective in solving complex,
real-world problems. However, injecting human knowledge into an RL agent may
require extensive effort and expertise on the human designer's part. To date,
human factors are generally not considered in the development and evaluation of
possible RL approaches. In this article, we set out to investigate how
different methods for injecting human knowledge are applied, in practice, by
human designers of varying levels of knowledge and skill. We perform the first
empirical evaluation of several methods, including a newly proposed method
named SASS which is based on the notion of similarities in the agent's
state-action space. Through this human study, consisting of 51 human
participants, we shed new light on the human factors that play a key role in
RL. We find that the classical reward shaping technique seems to be the most
natural method for most designers, both expert and non-expert, to speed up RL.
However, we further find that our proposed method SASS can be effectively and
efficiently combined with reward shaping, and provides a beneficial alternative
to using only a single speedup method with minimal human designer effort
overhead.",2018-05-15T13:51:31Z,"Ariel Rosenfeld, Moshe Cohen, Matthew E. Taylor, Sarit Kraus"

outlier traces in the data. For that we extend Dynamic Bayesian Networks to
model the normal behavior found in log files. We introduce a new algorithm that
is able to learn a model of a log file starting from the data itself. The model

1805.08322v4,Teaching Multiple Concepts to a Forgetful Learner,"How can we help a forgetful learner learn multiple concepts within a limited
time frame? While there have been extensive studies in designing optimal
schedules for teaching a single concept given a learner's memory model,
existing approaches for teaching multiple concepts are typically based on
heuristic scheduling techniques without theoretical guarantees. In this paper,
we look at the problem from the perspective of discrete optimization and
introduce a novel algorithmic framework for teaching multiple concepts with
strong performance guarantees. Our framework is both generic, allowing the
design of teaching schedules for different memory models, and also interactive,
allowing the teacher to adapt the schedule to the underlying forgetting
mechanisms of the learner. Furthermore, for a well-known memory model, we are
able to identify a regime of model parameters where our framework is guaranteed
to achieve high performance. We perform extensive evaluations using simulations
along with real user studies in two concrete applications: (i) an educational
app for online vocabulary teaching; and (ii) an app for teaching novices how to
recognize animal species from images. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our algorithm compared to popular heuristic approaches.",2018-05-21T23:34:11Z,"Anette Hunziker, Yuxin Chen, Oisin Mac Aodha, Manuel Gomez Rodriguez, Andreas Krause, Pietro Perona, Yisong Yue, Adish Singla"

1808.05032v1,"Deep RTS: A Game Environment for Deep Reinforcement Learning in
  Real-Time Strategy Games","Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of research that has blossomed
tremendously in recent years and has shown remarkable potential for artificial
intelligence based opponents in computer games. This success is primarily due
to the vast capabilities of convolutional neural networks, that can extract
useful features from noisy and complex data. Games are excellent tools to test
and push the boundaries of novel RL algorithms because they give valuable
insight into how well an algorithm can perform in isolated environments without
the real-life consequences. Real-time strategy games (RTS) is a genre that has
tremendous complexity and challenges the player in short and long-term
planning. There is much research that focuses on applied RL in RTS games, and
novel advances are therefore anticipated in the not too distant future.
However, there are to date few environments for testing RTS AIs. Environments
in the literature are often either overly simplistic, such as microRTS, or
complex and without the possibility for accelerated learning on consumer
hardware like StarCraft II. This paper introduces the Deep RTS game environment
for testing cutting-edge artificial intelligence algorithms for RTS games. Deep
RTS is a high-performance RTS game made specifically for artificial
intelligence research. It supports accelerated learning, meaning that it can
learn at a magnitude of 50 000 times faster compared to existing RTS games.
Deep RTS has a flexible configuration, enabling research in several different
RTS scenarios, including partially observable state-spaces and map complexity.
We show that Deep RTS lives up to our promises by comparing its performance
with microRTS, ELF, and StarCraft II on high-end consumer hardware. Using Deep
RTS, we show that a Deep Q-Network agent beats random-play agents over 70% of
the time. Deep RTS is publicly available at https://github.com/cair/DeepRTS.",2018-08-15T10:30:41Z,"Per-Arne Andersen, Morten Goodwin, Ole-Christoffer Granmo"

likely that the solution to these problems lies in short- and long-term

as they provide a flexible, reproducible, and easy to control environment.
Regardless, few games feature a state-space where results in exploration,
